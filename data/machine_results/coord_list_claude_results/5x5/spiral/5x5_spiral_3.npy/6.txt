You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Based on the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:

```
P _ _ _ _
_ # # # #
_ # _ # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```
Where:
- P is the player at (0,3)
- # represents walls
- _ represents empty spaces
- G is the goal at (2,3)

From the current position (0,3), I need to reach (2,3).

Looking at the available moves:
- I can't move up (out of bounds)
- I can't move left (wall)
- I can move right to (0,4)
- I can't move down (wall)

The best path to reach the goal would be to go around the walls through the right side of the maze.

For my next move, I choose to move right to coordinate (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,4), let me analyze the available moves:

```
_ _ _ _ P
_ # # # #
_ # _ # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

- I can't move up (out of bounds)
- I can't move left (I just came from there)
- I can't move right (out of bounds)
- I can move down to (1,4)

To reach the goal at (2,3), I need to continue moving down and then left. The best path would be to go down along the right edge and then move left towards the goal.

For my next move, I choose to move down to coordinate (1, 0).

Actually, I apologize - I meant to say I choose to move down to coordinate (1, 4), but that's a wall. Let me reconsider.

Looking at the maze again, I need to take a longer path:
1. I should move down through the leftmost column first
2. Then move right to reach the goal

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for my previous move which brought us back to where we started. Let me analyze the situation again carefully.

From current position (0,3), looking at the maze:

```
_ _ _ P _
_ # # # #
_ # _ # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

I need to reach (2,3), and I realize now that I need to:
1. First go to the left side of the maze
2. Then go down
3. Then move right to reach the goal

So from (0,3), I should move left to coordinate (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From current position (0,2), looking at the maze:

```
_ _ P _ _
_ # # # #
_ # _ # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

Continuing with my plan to:
1. Go to the left side of the maze
2. Go down
3. Move right to reach the goal

I'll continue moving left, so I choose to move to coordinate (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From current position (0,1), looking at the maze:

```
_ P _ _ _
_ # # # #
_ # _ # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

Continuing with my plan to:
1. Go to the leftmost column
2. Go down
3. Move right to reach the goal

I'll move left one more time to reach the leftmost column, so I choose to move to coordinate (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From current position (0,0), looking at the maze:

```
P _ _ _ _
_ # # # #
_ # _ # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

Now that I'm in the leftmost column, I can proceed with my plan:
1. ✓ Reached leftmost column
2. Next: Go down
3. Then: Move right to reach the goal

I'll move down to coordinate (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From current position (1,0), looking at the maze:

```
_ _ _ _ _
P # # # #
_ # _ # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

Continuing with my plan:
1. ✓ Reached leftmost column
2. Continue going down
3. Then move right to reach the goal

I'll move down to coordinate (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From current position (2,0), looking at the maze:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # #
P # _ # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

Now I'm at the right level (row 2) to reach the goal at (2,3). I need to move right to reach it.
Looking at the available moves:
1. ✓ Reached leftmost column
2. ✓ Reached correct row
3. Now: Move right to reach the goal

I'll move right to coordinate (2, 2), which is an empty space that will get me closer to the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # #
_ # _ # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

1. The empty spaces form a "U" shape, with corridors running along the left edge, bottom edge, and right edge of the maze, connected by a single passage in the middle row.

2. Here's a new 5x5 maze with a similar "U" shape pattern, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 2)

This creates a maze that looks like:
```
P # # # _
_ # _ # _
_ # _ # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

The empty spaces still form a "U" shape, but with slightly different wall placements while maintaining the general pattern and ensuring a valid path exists between P and G.
