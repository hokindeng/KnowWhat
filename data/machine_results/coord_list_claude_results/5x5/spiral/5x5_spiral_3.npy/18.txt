You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Based on the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:

```
P _ _ _ _
_ # # # #
_ # _ # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```
Where:
- P is the player at (0,3)
- # represents walls
- _ represents empty spaces
- G is the goal at (2,3)

From the current position (0,3), I need to reach (2,3).

Looking at the available moves:
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can move down to (1,3), but that's a wall
- I can move left to (0,2)
- I can move right to (0,4)

The best path to reach the goal would be to:
1. Move right to get to (0,4)
2. Then down through the right side to (2,4)
3. Then left to reach the goal at (2,3)

Therefore, for my next move, I choose to move right to coordinate (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,4), I can see that I need to continue with my planned path. 

Looking at the available moves from (0,4):
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can move down to (1,4), but that's a wall
- I can move left to (0,3)
- I can't move right (outside maze)

Following my planned route to reach (2,3):
1. I need to move down through the right side of the maze
2. Then left to reach the goal

Therefore, I need to get to (2,4) first. Since I can't move directly down due to the wall at (1,4), I'll need to find another path.

I'll move left to (0,3) to try to find an alternate route.

My next move is to coordinate (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice I've returned to my starting position at (0,3). I need to rethink my strategy.

From (0,3), looking at my available moves:
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can't move down (wall at 1,3)
- I can move left to (0,2)
- I can move right to (0,4)

Since moving right didn't lead to a solution, let me try moving left to explore that path. This might allow me to find a route around the walls to reach the goal at (2,3).

My next move is to coordinate (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,2), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can't move down (wall at 1,2)
- I can move left to (0,1)
- I can move right to (0,3)

Looking at the overall maze structure, I realize I need to find a path that goes around the walls. Since I can't go through the walls directly, I should try to go around them by going to the left side of the maze and then down.

I'll move left to (0,1) to continue exploring this path.

My next move is to coordinate (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,1), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can't move down (wall at 1,1)
- I can move left to (0,0)
- I can move right to (0,2)

I'm continuing with my strategy to go around the walls by using the left side of the maze. Moving to (0,0) will allow me to then move down through the leftmost column, which appears to be clear of walls.

My next move is to coordinate (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,0), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can move down to (1,0)
- I can't move left (outside maze)
- I can move right to (0,1)

Now that I'm at (0,0), I can start moving down through the leftmost column, which is clear of walls. This will allow me to get below the wall section and then move right towards the goal.

My next move is to coordinate (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1,0), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can move up to (0,0)
- I can move down to (2,0)
- I can't move left (outside maze)
- I can't move right (wall at 1,1)

Continuing with my strategy to go around the walls using the left side, I should keep moving down. Moving to (2,0) will get me to the same row as the goal, and from there I can start moving right to reach it.

My next move is to coordinate (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,0), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can move up to (1,0)
- I can move down to (3,0)
- I can't move left (outside maze)
- I can't move right (wall at 2,1)

Now that I'm at row 2 (same as the goal), I need to find a way to move right to reach (2,3). Since I can't move directly right due to the wall at (2,1), I'll need to go down and find another path.

Moving to (3,0) will allow me to potentially find a path around the remaining walls to reach the goal.

My next move is to coordinate (3,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,0), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can move up to (2,0)
- I can move down to (4,0)
- I can't move left (outside maze)
- I can't move right (wall at 3,1)

I'm now at (3,0), and I need to find a path to (2,3). Since I can't move right due to walls at (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3), I should move down to (4,0) and then try to move right through the bottom row, which appears to be clear of walls. This will allow me to eventually move up to reach the goal.

My next move is to coordinate (4,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,0), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can move up to (3,0)
- I can't move down (outside maze)
- I can't move left (outside maze)
- I can move right to (4,1)

Now that I'm in the bottom row, I can move right through the clear path until I'm under the goal position, then move up. The bottom row appears to be free of walls, so this should work.

My next move is to coordinate (4,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,1), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can move up (but there's a wall at 3,1)
- I can't move down (outside maze)
- I can move left to (4,0)
- I can move right to (4,2)

Continuing with my strategy to move right along the bottom row until I can move up towards the goal, I'll move to (4,2).

My next move is to coordinate (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,2), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can move up (but there's a wall at 3,2)
- I can't move down (outside maze)
- I can move left to (4,1)
- I can move right to (4,3)

Continuing along the bottom row until I can move up towards the goal, I'll move to (4,3). This will put me directly under the goal's column.

My next move is to coordinate (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,3), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can move up (but there's a wall at 3,3)
- I can't move down (outside maze)
- I can move left to (4,2)
- I can move right to (4,4)

Since I can't move up directly to reach the goal due to the wall at (3,3), I need to move right to (4,4) and then try to find a path up from there.

My next move is to coordinate (4,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,4), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can move up to (3,4)
- I can't move down (outside maze)
- I can move left to (4,3)
- I can't move right (outside maze)

Now I can start moving up through the rightmost column. Moving to (3,4) will get me closer to being able to reach the goal at (2,3).

My next move is to coordinate (3,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,4), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can move up to (2,4)
- I can move down to (4,4)
- I can't move left (wall at 3,3)
- I can't move right (outside maze)

I can now move up to (2,4), which will put me at the same row as the goal. From there, I'll be able to move left to reach the goal at (2,3).

My next move is to coordinate (2,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,4), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can't move up (wall at 1,4)
- I can move down to (3,4)
- I can move left to (2,3)
- I can't move right (outside maze)

Finally! I can now move left to (2,3), which is the goal position.

My next move is to coordinate (2,3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "U" shape. The path required going down the left side, across the bottom, and up the right side to reach the goal.

Here's a new 5x5 maze with a similar "U" shape pattern but with different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

This maze:
- Is 5x5 like the original
- Has a clear U-shaped corridor
- Has walls forming a vertical barrier in the middle (column 2)
- Allows a valid path from P to G following the U shape
- Has a different wall arrangement than the original
- Maintains the same start and goal positions

Visualized, it would look something like:
```
_ _ # P _
_ # # _ _
_ # # _ _
_ # # _ _
_ _ # _ _
```
Where the path would need to go left, down, across the bottom, and back up the right side to reach the goal, forming a U shape just like in the original maze.
