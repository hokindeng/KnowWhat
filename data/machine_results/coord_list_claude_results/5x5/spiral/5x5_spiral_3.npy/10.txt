You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Based on the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:

```
P _ _ _ _
_ # # # #
_ # _ # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```
Where:
- P is the player at (0,3)
- # represents walls
- _ represents empty spaces
- G is the goal at (2,3)

From the current position (0,3), I need to reach (2,3).

Looking at the available moves:
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can move down to (1,3), but that's a wall
- I can move left to (0,2)
- I can move right to (0,4)

The best path to reach the goal would be to:
1. Move right to get to (0,4)
2. Then down through the right side to (2,4)
3. Then left to reach the goal at (2,3)

Therefore, for my next move, I choose to move right to coordinate (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,4), I can see that I need to continue with my planned path. 

Looking at the available moves from (0,4):
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can move down to (1,4), but that's a wall
- I can move left to (0,3)
- I can't move right (outside maze)

Following my planned route to reach (2,3):
1. I need to move down through the right side of the maze
2. Then left to reach the goal

Therefore, I need to move down to coordinate (1,4), but since that's a wall, I need to find another path.

Let me revise my strategy:
1. Move left to (0,3)
2. Then find a path through the middle or left side of the maze

I choose to move left to coordinate (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice I've returned to my starting position at (0,3). Let me carefully analyze all possible paths again.

From current position (0,3):
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can't move down (wall at 1,3)
- I can move left to (0,2)
- I can move right to (0,4) (but I just came from there)

Looking at the overall maze structure, I realize I need to:
1. Move left towards the open path on the left side
2. Go down through the left side
3. Then move right to reach the goal at (2,3)

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,2), let me continue with the planned path.

Looking at the available moves:
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can't move down (wall at 1,2)
- I can move left to (0,1)
- I can move right to (0,3) (but I just came from there)

Following my strategy to:
1. Use the left side path to go down
2. Then move right to reach the goal

I choose to move left to coordinate (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,1), let me continue with the planned path.

Looking at the available moves:
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can't move down (wall at 1,1)
- I can move left to (0,0)
- I can move right to (0,2)

Following my strategy to:
1. Get to the leftmost path
2. Move down through the left side
3. Then move right to reach the goal

I choose to move left to coordinate (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,0), I can now start moving down through the left side of the maze.

Looking at the available moves:
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can move down to (1,0)
- I can't move left (outside maze)
- I can move right to (0,1)

Following my strategy:
1. Move down through the left side
2. Then navigate right to reach the goal

I choose to move down to coordinate (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1,0), I'll continue moving down through the left side.

Looking at the available moves:
- I can move up to (0,0)
- I can move down to (2,0)
- I can't move left (outside maze)
- I can't move right (wall at 1,1)

Following my strategy:
1. Continue moving down through the left side
2. Then navigate right to reach the goal

I choose to move down to coordinate (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,0), I need to start moving right to reach the goal at (2,3).

Looking at the available moves:
- I can move up to (1,0)
- I can move down to (3,0)
- I can't move left (outside maze)
- I can't move right (wall at 2,1)

Since I need to get to (2,3) and I'm already at row 2, I need to find a way to move right. I see there's an empty space at (2,2) that I can reach if I go around the wall at (2,1).

I choose to move down to coordinate (3,0) as part of the path to get around the wall and eventually reach (2,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, I can see that they form a "U" shape. The path requires going down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal.

Here's my new maze design with the same U-shape pattern:

Walls: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

In this new maze:
- The U-shape is maintained but mirrored horizontally
- The walls create a barrier in the middle, forcing the path to go around
- The player must travel down one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal
- The path from P to G is valid and achievable
- The overall dimensions are the same (5x5)
- The layout is different from the original while maintaining the same general shape concept
