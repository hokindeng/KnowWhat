You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze as follows:
- The walls form a large block in the middle
- I'm starting at position (4, 1)
- The goal is at (0, 1)
- There's a clear path along the left edge of the maze (column 0)

The best strategy would be to move upward along column 0 to reach the goal.

From my current position at (4, 1), I should move left to (4, 0), which is an empty space.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), I can see that I need to continue moving upward along column 0 to eventually reach a position where I can access the goal at (0, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces, I can move up to (3, 0), which is the next logical step toward the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing with my strategy of moving upward along column 0, I can see that the next empty space above my current position (3, 0) is at (2, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing to move upward along column 0, I can see that the next empty space above my current position (2, 0) is at (1, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (1, 0), and I need to reach the goal at (0, 1). Looking at the empty spaces, I can move up to (0, 0), which will put me in position to reach the goal at (0, 1) in the next move.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0, 0), I can make my final move to reach the goal at (0, 1) by moving one step right.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape. The vertical part of the L runs along column 0 from (4,0) to (0,0), and the horizontal part runs along row 0 from (0,0) to (0,4).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size that also forms an "L" shape, but rotated 90 degrees clockwise compared to the original:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the L runs along column 1 from (0,1) to (4,1)
- The horizontal part runs along row 4 from (4,1) to (4,4)
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The L shape is clearly recognizable but different from the original orientation
