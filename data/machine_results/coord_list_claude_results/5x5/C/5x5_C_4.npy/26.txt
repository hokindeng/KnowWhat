You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze as follows:
- The walls form a large block in the middle
- I'm starting at position (4, 1)
- The goal is at (0, 1)
- There's a clear path along the left edge of the maze (column 0)

The optimal solution would be to move upward along column 0 to reach the goal.

From my current position at (4, 1), I should first move left to (4, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to position (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4, 0), I can continue moving upward along column 0 towards the goal.

The next logical move is to go up one position to (3, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to position (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving upward along column 0 towards the goal.

From my current position at (3, 0), I'll move up to (2, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to position (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing my path upward along column 0 towards the goal.

From my current position at (2, 0), I'll move up to (1, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to position (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (1, 0), and the goal is at (0, 1). I'll move up one more time to (0, 0), which will put me in position to reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to position (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0, 0), I can make the final move to reach the goal.

From my current position at (0, 0), I'll move right to (0, 1), which is the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to position (0, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape. The vertical part of the L runs along the leftmost column (x=0), and the horizontal part runs along the bottom row (y=4).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an L shape, but with a different configuration:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 4)

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the L is two cells wide and runs along columns 0 and 1
- The horizontal part of the L runs along the bottom row (y=4)
- The walls block the upper-right portion of the maze
- There is a valid path from P to G following the L shape
- The overall L shape is maintained but with a different configuration than the original maze
