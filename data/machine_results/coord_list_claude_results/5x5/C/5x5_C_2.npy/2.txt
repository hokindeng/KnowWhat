You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze as follows:
# represents walls
. represents empty spaces
P represents player position
G represents goal position

#####
#....
#.###
#.###
#P.G#

Starting from position (4, 1), I need to reach (4, 3).
Looking at the available paths, I can see that I need to move up first to access the path that leads to the goal.

My next move should be to position (3, 1), which is one step up from the current position.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an inverted "T" shape. The vertical line of the T runs along the left side (from top to bottom), and the horizontal line runs along the top of the maze.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an inverted "T" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

This maze would look like:
#####
#P..#
#.###
#.###
#...#

The inverted T shape is maintained, but I've modified:
- The player starting position (moved to top)
- Some wall positions in the top right
- The path to the goal is still valid but slightly different
- The vertical line of the T is still on the left, and the horizontal line is still at the top
