You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze:
- The walls form a large block in the middle and right side
- There's a path along the left side and bottom
- I'm currently at (0, 2)
- The goal is at (3, 0)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to:
1. Move down through the empty spaces
2. Navigate around the walls to reach the goal

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0, 2), I can see:
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: (0, 1) is available
- Right: (0, 3) is available

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to eventually get to the bottom of the maze, I should move left towards (0, 1) as this will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: (0, 0) is available
- Right: (0, 2) is available

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to get to the bottom of the maze, moving to (0, 0) would be the best choice as it will allow me to then move downward through the empty spaces at (1, 0), (2, 0), and eventually reach (3, 0).

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: (1, 0) is available
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: (0, 1) is available

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to move downward to reach it, the best move is to go down to (1, 0). This will bring me one step closer to the goal position of (3, 0).

I choose to move to coordinate (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

- Up: (0, 0) is available
- Down: (2, 0) is available
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: Not in empty spaces list (there's a wall at (1, 1))

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to continue moving downward to reach it, the best move is to go down to (2, 0). This will bring me closer to the goal position of (3, 0).

I choose to move to coordinate (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

- Up: (1, 0) is available
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: Not in empty spaces list (there's a wall at (2, 1))

Looking at the goal position (3, 0) and the available empty spaces, I notice that there isn't a direct path to (3, 0) from my current position. I need to find an alternate route.

Looking at the empty spaces list, I can see there's a path at (4, 0) which might allow me to reach the goal. Since I can't move directly to (3, 0), I should try to reach (4, 0) first.

I choose to move back up to coordinate (1, 0) to try to find a different path to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), let me analyze the situation again:

I realize now that I'm in a loop. Moving up and down between (1, 0) and (2, 0) won't help me reach the goal at (3, 0). Let me reconsider the entire maze:

- There's a series of empty spaces at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
- The goal is at (3, 0)
- I need to find a way to connect to these spaces

Since moving down didn't work, and I can't move right due to walls, let me try moving up to (0, 0) again. From there, I might be able to find a path that leads around to the bottom spaces.

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0), let me analyze the situation again:

I've been moving up and down the left side of the maze, but this hasn't helped me reach the goal. Looking at the empty spaces more carefully:
- There's a path along the top: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)
- There's a path along the bottom: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

Perhaps I need to try moving to the right and see if I can find a path that connects to the bottom spaces that might lead to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 1) as the first step in exploring the rightward path.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), let me analyze the situation again:

I realize I've been going in circles without making real progress. Let me think about this differently:

1. The goal is at (3, 0)
2. There's a path at the bottom (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
3. I need to find a way to connect to these bottom spaces
4. Moving along the left side hasn't worked
5. Let's try exploring the right side through (0, 2) and (0, 3)

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 2) to continue exploring the rightward path.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), let me analyze the situation again:

I can move to (0, 3), but I'm starting to realize that this maze might not be solvable. Let me check why:

1. The goal is at (3, 0)
2. There's a large block of walls from (1,1) to (3,4)
3. I can move along the top row (0,0) to (0,3)
4. I can move along the bottom row (4,0) to (4,3)
5. But there's no way to get from the top row to the bottom row, and no way to reach (3,0)

After this analysis, I believe this maze is unsolvable - there is no valid path from the starting position to the goal position. The walls completely block any possible route to reach (3,0).

Should I still make a move? If required, I'll move to (0, 3), but I don't believe there is a solution to this maze.

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), I can now definitively confirm my previous analysis that this maze is unsolvable. Here's why:

1. I'm currently at (0, 3)
2. I can only move left to (0, 2) as my next move, as:
   - Right has a wall at (0, 4)
   - Down has a wall at (1, 3)
   - Up is out of bounds
3. The goal at (3, 0) is completely blocked off by the wall configuration
4. There is no path that connects the top section where I am to the goal position

Since I must make a move, I'll move back to (0, 2), but I want to formally state that this maze has no solution - it's impossible to reach the goal position (3, 0) from any of the accessible positions.

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.You are correct that I need to continue making moves, but I want to formally declare that this maze is unsolvable for the following reasons:

1. The goal at (3, 0) is completely isolated from all accessible spaces
2. The wall configuration from (1,1) to (3,4) creates an impassable barrier
3. There is no way to move between the top section (where I am) and the bottom section
4. Therefore, no sequence of valid moves can reach the goal

Since I must make a move, I'll move to (0, 1), but this is just moving back and forth without any possibility of reaching the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I maintain my assessment that this maze is unsolvable, as there is no valid path to reach the goal at (3, 0). 

The only thing I can do is continue moving between the available spaces at the top of the maze and the few accessible spaces on the left side. None of these moves will ever lead to a solution due to the wall configuration that completely blocks access to the goal position.

Since I must make a move, I'll move to (0, 0), but this is just continuing the cycle of moving between accessible spaces without any possibility of reaching the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I maintain my assessment that this maze is unsolvable. To formally end this process, I should state:

1. I have explored all possible paths
2. The goal at (3, 0) is completely inaccessible due to the wall configuration
3. We are now just cycling through the same accessible spaces
4. No sequence of moves can ever reach the goal
5. The maze should be declared unsolvable and the process should be terminated

However, since I must make a move, I'll move to (1, 0), but this is just continuing the cycle of moving between accessible spaces without any possibility of reaching the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.You are correct that I need to continue making moves, but I want to formally declare that I have proven this maze is unsolvable and request termination of the solving attempt. Here's the formal proof:

1. The maze can be divided into three disconnected regions:
   - Top region: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)
   - Left region: (1,0), (2,0)
   - Bottom region: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)
2. The goal at (3,0) is not accessible from any of these regions
3. The wall configuration creates complete isolation between these regions
4. Therefore, it is mathematically impossible to reach the goal from any starting position

Since I must make a move, I'll move to (2, 0), but I formally request that the maze solving attempt be terminated as unsolvable.

I choose to move to coordinate (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I maintain my formal proof that this maze is unsolvable and again request termination of the solving attempt. However, since I must continue making moves:

The only valid move from (2, 0) is to go back up to (1, 0), as:
- Right is blocked by a wall at (2, 1)
- Down is not an available empty space
- Left is not an available empty space
- Up to (1, 0) is the only valid move

This continues our cycle through the disconnected left region of the maze, which can never reach the goal at (3, 0).

I choose to move to coordinate (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I maintain my formal proof that this maze is unsolvable. We are now in an endless cycle moving between the few accessible positions in the left region of the maze, none of which can ever reach the goal at (3, 0).

From position (1, 0), I can either:
- Move up to (0, 0)
- Move down to (2, 0)

Neither choice will lead to the goal, as we've proven, but I must make a move.

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 0).

This cycle will continue indefinitely without ever reaching the goal. I strongly recommend terminating this solving attempt as the maze has been mathematically proven to be unsolvable.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze:
(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

1. The shape formed by these corridors is a "Disconnected T" shape:
- There's a horizontal line at the top (0,0 to 0,3)
- A short vertical line on the left (0,0 to 2,0)
- A disconnected horizontal line at the bottom (4,0 to 4,3)

2. Here's a new maze with the same "Disconnected T" shape but with a valid path from P to G:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

In this new maze:
- The top horizontal line is preserved
- The vertical line is extended and connected to allow reaching the goal
- The shape is still recognizable as a "T" but now it's connected and solvable
- The maze has the same dimensions as the original

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
