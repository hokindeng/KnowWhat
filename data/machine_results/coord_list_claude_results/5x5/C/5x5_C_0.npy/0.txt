You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze:
- The walls form a large block in the middle and right side
- There's a path along the left side and bottom
- I'm currently at (0, 2)
- The goal is at (3, 0)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to:
1. Move down through the empty spaces
2. Navigate around the walls to reach the goal

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0, 2), I can see:
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: (0, 1) is available
- Right: (0, 3) is available

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to eventually go down and right, I should first move left to (0, 1) to start making my way down towards the bottom path.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: (0, 0) is available
- Right: (0, 2) is available

Since my goal is at (3, 0) and I need to eventually make my way down, moving to (0, 0) would be the best choice as it gets me closer to the path that leads to the goal. From there, I can start moving down through the empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: (1, 0) is available
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: (0, 1) is available

Since my goal is at (3, 0), and I need to move downward to reach it, moving to (1, 0) is the best choice as it gets me directly closer to the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: (0, 0) is available
- Down: (2, 0) is available
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: Not in empty spaces list (blocked by wall at (1, 1))

Since my goal is at (3, 0), and I need to continue moving down to reach it, moving to (2, 0) is the best choice as it gets me directly closer to the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: (1, 0) is available
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: Not in empty spaces list (blocked by wall at (2, 1))

I notice that I can't directly move to (3, 0) from here, as it's not in the list of empty spaces. Looking at the overall maze structure and the empty spaces list, I need to find an alternate route. I see that there are empty spaces at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3), suggesting I might need to go up and find a different path.

Since moving down isn't possible and the only available move is up, I'll move back to (1, 0) and try to find another route.

Therefore, my next move is to: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), let me analyze the situation again:

Looking at the overall maze and my previous attempts:
1. I've tried going down the left side, but found I can't reach (3, 0) directly
2. Looking at the empty spaces again, I notice there's a path at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
3. I need to find a way to reach (3, 0) through a different route

Since going down didn't work, and I've already tried that path, I should move back up to (0, 0) and try to find a path that might lead around to the goal position through the empty spaces on the right side of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0), let me analyze the situation again:

Looking at the available moves and reconsidering the entire maze:
- I can move right to (0, 1), which leads to the path I've already tried
- I can move down to (1, 0), which also leads to the path I've already tried
- I notice there are empty spaces at (0, 2), (0, 3) that I haven't explored yet
- There's also a path of empty spaces at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

Since going down didn't work, and I need to find a way to connect to those empty spaces on the right side of the maze, I should try moving right and exploring that path.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), let me analyze the situation again:

Looking at the available moves:
- Left: (0, 0) is available
- Right: (0, 2) is available
- Up/Down: Not available

I've been going back and forth trying the left side path, which didn't work. I haven't fully explored the right side path yet. Since there are empty spaces at (0, 2) and (0, 3), and there's also that series of empty spaces at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), I should try moving right to explore if there's a way to connect to those spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), let me analyze the situation again:

Looking at the available moves:
- Left: (0, 1) is available
- Right: (0, 3) is available
- Up/Down: Not available

I've been exploring different paths but haven't found a solution yet. Let's think about this systematically:
1. The goal is at (3, 0)
2. I've tried the left path which didn't work
3. Looking at the empty spaces at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), I should continue exploring right to see if there's a way to connect to these spaces

Since I haven't fully explored the right side yet, I'll continue in that direction.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), let me analyze the situation:

Looking at the available moves:
- Left: (0, 2) is available
- Right: Blocked by wall at (0, 4)
- Up/Down: Not available

I've now reached a dead end on the right side path. Looking at the maze structure again:
1. The goal is at (3, 0)
2. The left path through (1, 0) and (2, 0) didn't work
3. The right path has led to a dead end
4. The empty spaces at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3) seem unreachable from my current position

Since I've hit a dead end and explored both main paths, I need to go back and reconsider my approach. Let's move back to (0, 2).

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After exploring all possible paths, I need to reassess the entire maze:

1. I've tried going down the left side through (1, 0) and (2, 0), but couldn't reach (3, 0)
2. I've tried going right to (0, 3), but hit a dead end
3. Looking at the empty spaces list again:
   - Left side: (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)
   - Right side: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
4. The goal at (3, 0) must be reachable somehow

I realize now that I might have missed something. The goal at (3, 0) isn't listed in either the walls or empty spaces, which could mean it's actually an accessible space that's just not listed in the empty spaces.

Let's go back to try the left path again, as it gets us closest to the goal. I'll move to (0, 1).

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.You're right - I had an important realization in my last move. Let me think this through again:

1. The goal at (3, 0) is not listed in the walls, which means it's not blocked
2. It's also not listed in the empty spaces, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's unreachable
3. The path down the left side through (1, 0) and (2, 0) gets us closest to the goal
4. Since (3, 0) is the goal and not listed as a wall, it must be accessible

Let's try the left path again. I'll move to (0, 0), then we can proceed down through (1, 0) and (2, 0), and hopefully to (3, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0), I'm now confident about the path:

1. The goal at (3, 0) is not listed as a wall, so it must be accessible
2. We can reach it through the left-side path
3. The next logical step is to move down to (1, 0)

Therefore, my next move is to: (1, 0)

This should put us on the path that will eventually lead to (3, 0) through (2, 0) and then directly to the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), and considering the goal position (3, 0), the corridors form:

1. The shape is an "L" (or inverted "L")
- There's a vertical corridor down the left side
- There's a horizontal corridor along the top
- The goal is reachable through the vertical part of the L

2. Here's a new maze with the same L-shape pattern but slightly different:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

This new maze:
- Maintains the L-shape corridor pattern
- Has the same overall size
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Has a different arrangement of walls while keeping the L-shape recognizable

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
