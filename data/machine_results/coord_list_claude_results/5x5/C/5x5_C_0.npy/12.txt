You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze like this:

(0,0) (0,1) (0,2)P (0,3) (0,4)#
(1,0)        #     #     #     #
(2,0)        #     #     #     #
(3,0)G       #     #     #     #
(4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4)#

Where:
- P is my current position at (0,2)
- G is the goal at (3,0)
- # represents walls
- Empty spaces are available for movement

To reach the goal at (3,0), I need to move downward through the available path. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see there's a path along the left side of the maze.

From my current position at (0,2), I should move left to (0,1) as my next move. This will help me get closer to the path that leads to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3,0). Looking at the available empty spaces, I can see that I need to move towards the left side of the maze to access the path that leads down to the goal.

From (0,1), I should move left to (0,0). This will position me at the start of the vertical path that leads down to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,0), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3,0). Looking at the available empty spaces, I can see that there's a path going down along the leftmost column of the maze.

From (0,0), I should move down to (1,0). This will bring me one step closer to the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1,0), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3,0). Looking at the available empty spaces, I can see that I should continue moving down along the leftmost column of the maze.

From (1,0), I should move down to (2,0). This will bring me closer to the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,0), I need to make my final move to reach the goal at (3,0). Looking at the available empty spaces, I can see that moving down one more step will take me directly to the goal position.

From (2,0), I should move down to (3,0), which is the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape. The path consists of a vertical corridor along the leftmost column from (0,0) to (3,0), and a horizontal corridor along the bottom row from (4,0) to (4,3).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different configuration:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the "L" is along the leftmost column (like the original)
- The horizontal part is along the bottom row (like the original)
- The player starts at the top of the "L" and needs to reach the end of the horizontal segment
- The walls are arranged differently but still maintain the "L" shape of the path
- The maze has the same 5x5 dimensions as the original
