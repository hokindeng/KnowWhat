You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze:
- The walls form a large block in the middle and right side
- There's a path along the left side and bottom
- I'm currently at (0, 2)
- The goal is at (3, 0)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to:
1. Move down through the empty spaces
2. Navigate around the walls to reach the goal

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0, 2), I can see:
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: (0, 1) is available
- Right: (0, 3) is available

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to eventually get to the bottom of the maze, I should move left towards (0, 1) as this will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: (0, 0) is available
- Right: (0, 2) is available

Since my goal is at (3, 0), and I need to get to the bottom of the maze, moving to (0, 0) would be the best choice as it:
1. Gets me closer to the path that leads to the goal
2. Allows me to eventually move down towards the bottom path

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: (1, 0) is available
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: (0, 1) is available

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to move along the bottom path to reach it, moving down to (1, 0) is the best choice because:
1. It moves me closer to the goal position
2. It follows the clear path along the bottom of the maze

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

- Up: (0, 0) is available
- Down: (2, 0) is available
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: Not in empty spaces list (blocked by wall at (1, 1))

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to continue along the bottom path to reach it, moving down to (2, 0) is the best choice because:
1. It moves me closer to the goal position at (3, 0)
2. It continues along the clear path at the bottom of the maze

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

- Up: (1, 0) is available
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: Not in empty spaces list (blocked by wall at (2, 1))

Looking at the goal position (3, 0) and the available empty spaces, I notice that there seems to be a gap in the path - there's no direct connection between my current position and the goal. This might indicate that I need to take a different route or that there might be a missing piece of information in the empty spaces list.

However, based on the information provided, I can only move up to (1, 0) as it's the only valid move available from my current position.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

- Up: (0, 0) is available
- Down: (2, 0) is available
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: Not in empty spaces list (blocked by wall at (1, 1))

I notice that we seem to be going back and forth between (1, 0) and (2, 0). Looking at the empty spaces list again, I see that (3, 0) (the goal position) is not listed in the empty spaces, and neither is there a clear path to (4, 0) which is listed as empty.

However, based on the available moves, moving down to (2, 0) is still the most logical choice as:
1. It keeps us closer to the goal's vertical position
2. Moving up would just take us further from the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for my previous confusion. I now realize we're in a loop between positions (1, 0) and (2, 0). Let me reassess the situation:

1. The goal is at (3, 0)
2. We're at (2, 0)
3. Looking at the empty spaces list, I notice that (3, 0) is not listed as an empty space, but (4, 0) is
4. This suggests there might be a path through (3, 0) that connects (2, 0) to (4, 0)

Even though (3, 0) is not explicitly listed in the empty spaces, since it's our goal position, it must be accessible. Therefore, I'm going to attempt to move to (3, 0) directly, as this seems to be the missing link in our path.

I choose to move to coordinate (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), and including (3, 0) which must be traversable as it's the goal, the path forms:

1. The shape is an "L" or "L-shape"
- It has a vertical segment along the left side (0,0 to 0,3)
- It has a horizontal segment along the bottom (0,0 to 4,0)
- There's also a parallel segment at (4,1 to 4,3)

2. Here's a new maze with an L-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 0)

This new maze:
- Maintains the L-shape of empty spaces
- Has a different start and goal position
- Has fewer walls but still creates a valid maze
- The L-shape is more pronounced with two clear corridors
- Provides a valid path from P to G
