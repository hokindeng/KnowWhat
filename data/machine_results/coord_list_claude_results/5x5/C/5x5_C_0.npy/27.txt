You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze:
- The walls form a large block in the middle and right side
- There's a path along the left side and bottom
- I'm currently at (0, 2)
- The goal is at (3, 0)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to:
1. Move down through the empty spaces
2. Navigate around the walls to reach the goal

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0, 2), I can see:
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: (0, 1) is available
- Right: (0, 3) is available

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to eventually go down and right, I should first move left to (0, 1) to start making my way down towards the bottom path.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: (0, 0) is available
- Right: (0, 2) is available

Since my goal is at (3, 0) and I need to eventually make my way down, moving to (0, 0) would be the best choice as it gets me closer to the path that leads to the goal. From there, I can start moving down through the empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: (1, 0) is available
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: (0, 1) is available

Since my goal is at (3, 0), and I need to move downward to reach it, moving to (1, 0) is the best choice as it gets me directly closer to the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: (0, 0) is available
- Down: (2, 0) is available
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: Not in empty spaces list (blocked by wall at (1, 1))

Since my goal is at (3, 0), and I need to continue moving down to reach it, moving to (2, 0) is the best choice as it gets me directly closer to the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: (1, 0) is available
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: Not in empty spaces list (blocked by wall at (2, 1))

I notice that I can't directly move to (3, 0) from here, as it's not in the list of empty spaces. Looking at the overall maze structure and the empty spaces list, I need to find an alternate route. I see that there are empty spaces at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3), suggesting I need to go up and find a different path.

Since I can't proceed directly to the goal from here, and I need to find another route, I should move back up to (1, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), let me analyze the situation again:

I realize now that I need to rethink my strategy. Looking at the empty spaces and the goal position more carefully:
- The goal is at (3, 0)
- There are empty spaces at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
- I need to find a path that might go around the walls to reach the goal

Since moving down directly didn't work, and looking at the pattern of empty spaces, it seems I need to go back up and try to find a path that might go around through the empty spaces at (0, 2), (0, 3) and then possibly down through the (4, x) spaces to reach the goal.

Therefore, I'll move back up to: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0), let me analyze the situation with a fresh perspective:

Looking at the empty spaces and the overall maze structure:
- I need to reach (3, 0)
- There's a path of empty spaces going right: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)
- Then there are empty spaces going down on the right side: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

I think the solution path should be:
1. Move right through the top empty spaces
2. Then down through the rightmost empty spaces
3. Finally back left to reach the goal

Following this strategy, I should start moving right.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), continuing with my strategy:

I need to continue moving right through the top empty spaces to eventually reach the path that goes down on the right side.

Looking at my available moves:
- Left: (0, 0) is available
- Right: (0, 2) is available
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list

Following my plan to move right along the top to reach the rightmost path, I should continue moving right.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), continuing with my strategy:

Looking at my available moves:
- Left: (0, 1) is available
- Right: (0, 3) is available
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list

Following my plan to move right along the top to reach the rightmost path that will eventually lead to the goal, I should continue moving right.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), let me analyze the situation:

Looking at my available moves:
- Left: (0, 2) is available
- Right: Blocked by wall at (0, 4)
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list

I notice that I've reached the end of the top path and I can't move right anymore. Looking at the empty spaces list, I see:
- (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3) form a path on the right side
- However, I can't directly access this path from my current position

Since I can't proceed further right and can't move down from here, I need to backtrack and try a different approach. I should move back left.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), I need to completely rethink my strategy:

I've discovered that:
1. The top-right path is a dead end
2. The direct downward path through (1,0), (2,0) didn't work earlier
3. Looking at the empty spaces again, I notice that (4,0) must be accessible somehow to reach (3,0)

Let me try going back to (0,0) and attempt a different approach. Since moving right didn't work and moving directly down didn't work, we need to find another way to reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), let me analyze the entire situation again:

Looking at the maze structure more carefully:
1. The goal is at (3, 0)
2. There's a path of empty spaces at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
3. We need to somehow connect to these spaces to reach the goal
4. Moving right led to a dead end
5. Moving directly down through (1,0), (2,0) also didn't work

Let's continue moving back to (0,0) and try to find a different approach. We might need to find a way to reach those empty spaces at (4,x) from a different angle.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0), let me do a complete reassessment:

1. The goal is at (3, 0)
2. We've tried:
   - Going right along the top (dead end)
   - Going down directly through (1,0), (2,0) (didn't work)
3. Looking at the empty spaces again:
   - (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3) form a vertical path on the right
   - (1, 0), (2, 0) are on the left side
   - (3, 0) is our goal but not listed as empty space

Let's try moving down to (1, 0) again, but this time with a different plan. Since we can see empty spaces at (4, x), there must be a way to reach them, and they might connect to our goal at (3, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), let me analyze again:

1. We're at (1, 0)
2. The goal is at (3, 0)
3. Looking at the empty spaces:
   - (2, 0) is available below us
   - (4, 0) is further down
   - There must be a way to connect these spaces

Since (2, 0) is available and it's moving us in the direction of both (4, 0) and our goal (3, 0), let's try moving down again. Even though this path didn't work before, we might have missed something in our previous attempts.

Therefore, my next move is to: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 0), let me carefully analyze the situation:

1. We're at (2, 0)
2. The goal is at (3, 0)
3. Looking at the empty spaces:
   - (4, 0) is available but we can't reach it directly
   - (1, 0) is behind us
   - No other adjacent spaces are in the empty list

I notice that (3, 0), our goal position, is not listed in either the walls or empty spaces. This might be significant - it could mean that the goal position is actually accessible even though it's not listed in the empty spaces!

Since we're at (2, 0) and our goal is at (3, 0), let's try moving directly to the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze:
(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

1. The shape formed by these empty spaces resembles an "L" shape:
- One part extends horizontally along the top (0,0 to 0,3)
- One part extends vertically down the left side (0,0 to 2,0)
- Another vertical segment on the right side (4,0 to 4,3)

2. Here's a new maze with the same L-shaped pattern but with slightly different coordinates:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

This new maze maintains the L-shape pattern but has a wider corridor in the vertical portion of the L, while still providing a valid path from player to goal.
