You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze:
- The walls form a large block in the middle and right side
- There's a path along the left side and bottom
- I'm currently at (0, 2)
- The goal is at (3, 0)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to:
1. Move down through the empty spaces
2. Navigate around the walls to reach the goal

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0, 2), I can see:
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: (0, 1) is available
- Right: (0, 3) is available

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to eventually go down and right, I should first move left to (0, 1) to start making my way down towards the bottom path.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: (0, 0) is available
- Right: (0, 2) is available

Since my goal is at (3, 0) and I need to eventually make my way down, moving to (0, 0) would be the best choice as it gets me closer to the path that leads to the goal. From there, I can start moving down through the empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: (1, 0) is available
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: (0, 1) is available

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to move downward to reach it, the best move is to go down to (1, 0). This moves me directly closer to the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: (0, 0) is available
- Down: (2, 0) is available
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: Not in empty spaces list (blocked by wall at (1, 1))

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to continue moving down to reach it, the best move is to go down to (2, 0). This moves me directly closer to the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: (1, 0) is available
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: Not in empty spaces list (blocked by wall at (2, 1))

Looking at the goal position (3, 0) and the available empty spaces, I notice that there isn't a direct path to the goal from my current position. I need to find an alternate route.

Since (4, 0) is in the empty spaces list, I should try to reach that position and then move left to the goal. However, I can't move directly down as that space isn't available. I need to backtrack.

The best move is to go back up to (1, 0), which will allow me to find another path to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), let me analyze the situation again:

Looking at the maze structure and empty spaces:
- I've tried going down the left side, but there's no direct path to (3, 0)
- I notice there's a path of empty spaces at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
- I need to find a way to reach (4, 0) and then move left to (3, 0)

Looking at my available moves:
- Up: (0, 0) is available
- Down: (2, 0) is available (but we know this doesn't lead anywhere)
- Left/Right: Not available

Since going down doesn't work, and I need to eventually reach (4, 0), I should try going up to (0, 0) and then try to find a path around to reach (4, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0), let me analyze the situation again:

Looking at my available moves:
- Right: (0, 1) is available
- Down: (1, 0) is available (but we know this path doesn't work)

I need to find a path to (4, 0) to eventually reach (3, 0). Looking at the empty spaces, there's a path along (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3). To reach this, I should try going through the right side of the maze.

Let me move right to (0, 1) to start exploring that path.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), let me analyze the situation again:

Looking at my available moves:
- Left: (0, 0) (but we've already tried that path)
- Right: (0, 2) is available

I need to continue exploring the right side path to try to reach (4, 0). The empty spaces show there's a path at (0, 2), (0, 3) and then down through (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3).

Let me continue moving right to explore this path.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), let me analyze the situation again:

Looking at my available moves:
- Left: (0, 1) is available
- Right: (0, 3) is available

I need to continue exploring the right side path to try to reach (4, 0). Looking at the empty spaces, I can see (0, 3) is available, and then there's a path at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3) that I need to try to reach.

Let me continue moving right to explore this path.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), let me analyze the situation:

Looking at my available moves:
- Left: (0, 2) is available
- Right: Blocked by wall at (0, 4)
- Down: Blocked by wall at (1, 3)

I've reached a dead end on the right side of the maze. There's no way to continue forward or down from here to reach the (4, 0) path. I need to backtrack and try a different approach.

Let me move back left.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), let me completely reassess the situation:

1. I've tried:
   - Going down the left side through (1,0) and (2,0) - didn't work
   - Going right side through (0,3) - reached a dead end

2. Looking at the overall maze structure:
   - The goal is at (3,0)
   - There's a path at (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)
   - But I can't reach it from either the left side or right side paths I've tried

3. Current available moves:
   - Left: (0,1) is available

Since both forward paths I've tried don't work, I need to backtrack further and try to find another approach.

Let me move back to (0,1).

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me do a complete reassessment of the maze and all possible paths:

1. We've tried:
   - Left path: Going down through (1,0) and (2,0) - didn't reach goal
   - Right path: Going through (0,2) and (0,3) - dead end

2. Looking at the empty spaces again:
   - (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)
   - (1,0), (2,0)
   - (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)

3. Current available moves:
   - Left: (0,0)
   - Right: (0,2) (already explored)

I notice that we haven't fully explored what happens if we go all the way down to (4,0). From our previous attempts, we only went as far as (2,0). Maybe there's a way to reach (4,0) that we haven't tried yet.

Let's go back to (0,0) and try to find a different path down.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0), let me analyze again:

1. Available moves:
   - Right: (0,1)
   - Down: (1,0)

2. Looking at the empty spaces pattern:
   - We need to somehow reach (4,0)
   - From there, we could potentially move left to (3,0)
   - We haven't fully explored the path down to (4,0)

Let's try going down to (1,0) again, but this time with the intention of finding a way to (4,0) rather than stopping at (2,0).

Therefore, my next move is to: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), let me analyze again:

1. Available moves:
   - Up: (0,0)
   - Down: (2,0)

2. Looking at the empty spaces and goal:
   - We need to reach (4,0) to potentially get to (3,0)
   - The only way forward is through (2,0)
   - Even though we tried this before, let's continue down to see if we can reach (4,0)

Let's move down to (2,0) and see if we can find a path to (4,0) that we might have missed before.

Therefore, my next move is to: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 0), let me carefully analyze the situation:

1. Available moves:
   - Up: (1,0)
   - Down: Not available (this space isn't in the empty list)
   - Left/Right: Blocked by walls

2. Critical realization:
   - Looking at the empty spaces list, there's no direct connection between where I am (2,0) and (4,0)
   - There's no space at (3,0) in the empty spaces list, even though that's the goal
   - This suggests that the goal position (3,0) might be reachable even though it's not listed in the empty spaces

Since the goal is at (3,0) and I'm at (2,0), and we know the goal must be reachable, let me try moving directly to the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze:
(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

1. The shape formed by these corridors resembles an "L" shape - there's a vertical corridor along the left side and a horizontal corridor along the bottom, forming a 90-degree angle.

2. Here's a new maze with the same L-shaped pattern but slightly different:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

In this new maze:
- The L-shape is preserved but wider (2 spaces wide instead of 1)
- The vertical part of the L runs along the left side
- The horizontal part runs along the bottom
- There's a valid path from P to G
- The overall dimensions are the same as the original
- The shape is clearly recognizable as an L
