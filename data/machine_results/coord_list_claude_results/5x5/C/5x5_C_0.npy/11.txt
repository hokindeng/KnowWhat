You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze:
- The walls form a large block in the middle and right side
- There's a path along the left side and bottom
- I'm currently at (0, 2)
- The goal is at (3, 0)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to:
1. Move down through the empty spaces
2. Navigate around the walls to reach the goal

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0, 2), I can see:
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: (0, 1) is available
- Right: (0, 3) is available

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to eventually go down and right, I should first move left to (0, 1) to start making my way down towards the bottom path.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: (0, 0) is available
- Right: (0, 2) is available

Since my goal is at (3, 0) and I need to eventually make my way down, moving to (0, 0) would be the best choice as it gets me closer to the path that leads to the goal. From there, I can start moving down through the empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: (1, 0) is available
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: (0, 1) is available

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to move downward to reach it, the best move is to go down to (1, 0). This moves me directly closer to the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: (0, 0) is available
- Down: (2, 0) is available
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: Not in empty spaces list (there's a wall at (1, 1))

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to continue moving down to reach it, the best move is to go down to (2, 0). This moves me directly closer to the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: (1, 0) is available
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: Not in empty spaces list (there's a wall at (2, 1))

I notice that I can't move directly to (3, 0) (the goal) because it's not in the empty spaces list. Looking at the overall maze structure, I need to find a path that might go around. I can see that (4, 0) is in the empty spaces list, which could provide a path to the goal.

Since I can't move directly to the goal, and I need to find an alternate route, I should move up to (1, 0) to try a different approach.

Therefore, my next move is to: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent spaces:
- Up: (0, 0) is available
- Down: (2, 0) is available
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: Not in empty spaces list (there's a wall at (1, 1))

I seem to be in a loop between (1, 0) and (2, 0). Let me reconsider the overall maze structure:
- The goal is at (3, 0)
- There's a path along the bottom through (4, 0)
- I need to find a way to reach that bottom path

Since moving up and down between (1, 0) and (2, 0) isn't getting me closer to the solution, I should try moving down to (2, 0) again and see if there's another path I missed.

Therefore, my next move is to: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for my previous confusion. Let me carefully analyze the situation again:

1. I'm at (2, 0)
2. The goal is at (3, 0)
3. Looking at the empty spaces list, I notice that (4, 0) is available, but (3, 0) isn't listed in either walls or empty spaces
4. This likely means that (3, 0), being the goal, is actually accessible but just not listed in the empty spaces

Given this realization, since I'm at (2, 0) and the goal is at (3, 0), and there's no wall listed at (3, 0), I should be able to move directly to (3, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape. The path starts from the top, goes down along the left side, and then turns right along the bottom.

Here's my new maze design with an "L" shaped path:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

This new maze:
1. Is 5x5 like the original
2. Has an "L" shaped corridor
3. Has a valid path from P to G
4. Is different from the original (walls are shifted and the goal is in a different location)
5. The "L" shape is formed by a vertical corridor along the left side and a horizontal corridor along the bottom
