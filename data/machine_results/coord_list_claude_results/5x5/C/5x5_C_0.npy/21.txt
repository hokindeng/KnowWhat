You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze:
- The walls form a large blocked area on the right side
- There's a path along the left side and bottom
- I need to get from (0,2) to (3,0)

Current position is (0,2), and I need to move towards (3,0). Looking at the empty spaces:
- I can move up to (0,1)
- I can move down to (0,3)
- I can't move right (wall)
- I can't move left (out of bounds)

Since the goal is at (3,0), and I need to get to the bottom of the maze, I should move down to position (0,3).

My next move is: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,3), I need to continue finding a path to (3,0).

Looking at my available moves:
- I can move up to (0,2)
- I can't move down (wall at 0,4)
- I can't move right (wall)
- I can't move left (out of bounds)

Since I need to get to (3,0), and there's a path along the bottom of the maze, I should move back up to (0,2) and then try to find a path through the bottom of the maze.

My next move is: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my position again. I'm back at (0,2) and need to get to (3,0).

Looking at my available moves:
- I can move up to (0,1)
- I can move down to (0,3)
- I can't move right (wall)
- I can't move left (out of bounds)

I've already tried going down, and that didn't lead to a useful path. Since I need to get to (3,0), and there appears to be a path along the top of the maze (through 0,1 -> 0,0 -> 1,0 -> 2,0 -> 3,0), I should move up.

My next move is: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,1), I need to continue towards (3,0).

Looking at my available moves:
- I can move up to (0,0)
- I can move down to (0,2)
- I can't move right (wall)
- I can't move left (out of bounds)

Since I'm trying to get to (3,0), and I can see there's a path along the top row through (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0), I should move up to (0,0).

My next move is: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,0), I need to continue towards (3,0).

Looking at my available moves:
- I can't move up (out of bounds)
- I can move down to (0,1)
- I can move right to (1,0)
- I can't move left (out of bounds)

Since my goal is at (3,0) and there's a clear path along the bottom row (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0), I should move right to get closer to the goal.

My next move is: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1,0), I need to continue towards (3,0).

Looking at my available moves:
- I can't move up (out of bounds)
- I can't move down (wall at 1,1)
- I can move right to (2,0)
- I can move left to (0,0)

Since my goal is at (3,0) and I'm following the path along the bottom row, I should continue moving right to get closer to the goal.

My next move is: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,0), I need to continue towards (3,0).

Looking at my available moves:
- I can't move up (out of bounds)
- I can't move down (wall at 2,1)
- I can move right to (3,0)
- I can move left to (1,0)

Since my goal is at (3,0) and I'm right next to it, I should move right to reach the goal.

My next move is: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape. The path runs from the top, down the left side, and then across the bottom of the maze.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with an "L" shaped corridor, but with a different arrangement than the original:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared to the original
- The vertical part of the "L" is on the right side instead of the left
- The horizontal part is still along the bottom
- It maintains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- The overall dimensions are still 5x5
- The shape is clearly recognizable as an "L"
