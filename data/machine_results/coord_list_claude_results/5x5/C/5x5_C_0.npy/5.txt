You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze:
- The walls form a large block in the middle and right side
- There's a path along the left side and bottom
- I'm currently at (0, 2)
- The goal is at (3, 0)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to:
1. Move down through the empty spaces
2. Navigate around the walls to reach the goal

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0, 2), I can see:
- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: (0, 1) is available
- Right: (0, 3) is available

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to eventually get to the bottom of the maze, I should move left towards (0, 1) as this will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: Not in empty spaces list
- Left: (0, 0) is available
- Right: (0, 2) is available

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to get to the bottom of the maze, moving to (0, 0) would be the best choice as it will allow me to then move downward through the empty spaces at (1, 0), (2, 0), and eventually reach (3, 0).

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

- Up: Not in empty spaces list
- Down: (1, 0) is available
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: (0, 1) is available

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to move downward to reach it, the best move is to go down to (1, 0). This will bring me one step closer to the goal position at (3, 0).

I choose to move to coordinate (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

- Up: (0, 0) is available
- Down: (2, 0) is available
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: Not in empty spaces list (there's a wall at (1, 1))

Since the goal is at (3, 0), and I need to continue moving downward to reach it, the best move is to go down to (2, 0). This will bring me one step closer to the goal position at (3, 0).

I choose to move to coordinate (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

- Up: (1, 0) is available
- Down: Not in empty spaces list (but this is where the goal is at (3, 0))
- Left: Not in empty spaces list
- Right: Not in empty spaces list (there's a wall at (2, 1))

Since the goal is at (3, 0) and it's directly below my current position, even though (3, 0) is not listed in the empty spaces, I know it must be accessible since it's the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinate (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape. The path starts from the top, goes down along the left edge, and then turns right at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 2)

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the "L" runs down the leftmost column
- The horizontal part of the "L" extends right at the bottom
- The path from P to G is valid and follows the L-shape
- The maze has the same dimensions as the original
- The arrangement of walls and spaces is different from the original while maintaining the L-shape pattern
