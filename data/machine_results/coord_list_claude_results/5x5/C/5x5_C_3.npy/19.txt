You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze (where # represents walls, . represents empty spaces, P is player, and G is goal):

```
# # # # #
# # # # #
. . # # #
. # # # #
. P . # #
```

Current position: (4, 1)
Goal position: (2, 0)

Looking at the available empty spaces and considering I need to reach (2, 0), I should move upward since:
1. I'm currently at (4, 1)
2. There's an empty space at (3, 0)
3. This will bring me closer to the goal

Therefore, my next move should be to coordinate (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

```
# # # # #
# # # # #
. . # # #
P # # # #
. . . # #
```

Current position: (3, 0)
Goal position: (2, 0)

From my current position at (3, 0), I need to move up to reach the goal. The space above me at (2, 0) is empty and is actually the goal position.

Therefore, my next move should be to coordinate (2, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape (or backwards "L" shape, depending on perspective).

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (1, 1)

This creates a maze that looks like this:
```
# # # # #
# G # # #
# . # # #
# . # # #
P . # # #
```

The empty spaces form an "L" shape, but it's rotated 90 degrees compared to the original maze. The path is still valid as the player can move from P to G through the connected empty spaces, and the overall shape of the corridor maintains the "L" pattern.
