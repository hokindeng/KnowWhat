You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
# # # # #
# # # # #
. . # #  
. # # #  
. P . #  

Where:
# represents walls
. represents empty spaces
P is the player position (4,1)
G is the goal position (2,0)

Starting from position (4,1), I need to reach (2,0).
Looking at the available empty spaces and considering valid moves (up, down, left, right), I can see that:
- From (4,1), I can move up to (3,0) or right to (4,2)
- Moving up towards (3,0) will get me closer to the goal

Therefore, my next move should be up to coordinate (3,0).

I choose to move to: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
# # # # #
# # # # #
. . # #  
P # # #  
. . . #  

Where I am now at (3,0) and need to reach (2,0).

From my current position at (3,0), I can move:
- Up to (2,0), which is the goal
- Down to (4,0)

Since I can directly reach the goal from here, I'll move up to (2,0).

I choose to move to: (2,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape:
# # # # #
# # # # #
G . # #  
. # # #  
. P . #  

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

This creates an "L" shape rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise:
# # # # #
# G # # #
# . # # #
# . # # #
. P # # #

The path still allows movement from P to G through empty spaces, and the L-shape is preserved but in a different orientation.
