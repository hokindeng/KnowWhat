You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze structure:

Based on the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
# # # # #
# . . . #
# . # # #
# P # # #
# . . . #

Where:
# represents walls
. represents empty spaces
P is the player position
G is the goal (at (1,3))

From my current position at (3,1), I need to reach (1,3).
Looking at the available moves:
- Up: (2,1) is an empty space
- Down: (4,1) is an empty space
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall

Since the goal is above and to the right of my current position, moving up towards (2,1) would be the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:

The maze looks like this:
# # # # #
# . . . #
# P # # #
# . # # #
# . . . #

From my current position at (2,1), I need to reach (1,3).
Looking at the available moves:
- Up: (1,1) is an empty space
- Down: (3,1) is an empty space
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall

Since the goal is above and to the right of my current position, moving up to (1,1) would be the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (1,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:

The maze looks like this:
# # # # #
# P . G #
# . # # #
# . # # #
# . . . #

From my current position at (1,1), I need to reach (1,3).
Looking at the available moves:
- Up: blocked by wall
- Down: (2,1) is an empty space
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: (1,2) is an empty space

Since the goal is to the right of my current position, and there's a clear path in that direction, moving right to (1,2) would be the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:

The maze looks like this:
# # # # #
# . P G #
# . # # #
# . # # #
# . . . #

From my current position at (1,2), I need to reach (1,3).
Looking at the available moves:
- Up: blocked by wall
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: (1,1) is an empty space
- Right: (1,3) is the goal

Since the goal is directly to the right of my current position at (1,3), and it's an available move, I should move there.

I choose to move to coordinate (1,3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape. The vertical part of the L runs down the left side, and the horizontal part extends to the right at the bottom.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an L shape, but with a different arrangement than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

This maze would look like:
# # # # #
# P # # #
# . # # #
# . # # #
. . . . #

The L shape is rotated 90 degrees compared to the original, but still maintains the characteristic L form with one long corridor and one perpendicular corridor meeting at a corner. The path from P to G is valid and follows the L-shaped corridor.
