You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze:
- The walls form barriers
- I need to move from current position (3, 2) to goal position (0, 2)
- I can only move through empty spaces
- I can move up, down, left, or right

Looking at my current position (3, 2):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (2, 2)
- Down leads to (3, 3) which is an empty space
- Left leads to (3, 1) which is an empty space
- Right would be (3, 3) which is an empty space

To reach the goal (0, 2), I need to generally move upward and leftward. Since I can't move up directly due to the wall, I should first move left to (3, 1), which will give me more options for subsequent moves.

I choose to move to coordinate (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my new position at (3, 1), let me analyze the possible moves:
- Up leads to (2, 1) which is an empty space
- Down leads to (3, 2) which is an empty space (but that's where I came from)
- Left is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right leads to (3, 2) which is an empty space

Since my goal is at (0, 2) and I need to move upward and eventually right to reach it, the best move is to go up to (2, 1). This will help me progress toward the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 1), let me analyze the possible moves:
- Up leads to (1, 1) which is an empty space
- Down leads to (3, 1) which is an empty space (but that's where I came from)
- Left is blocked by a wall at (2, 0)
- Right is blocked by a wall at (2, 2)

Since my goal is at (0, 2), and I need to continue moving upward to eventually reach it, the best move is to go up to (1, 1). This will get me closer to the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinate (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 1), let me analyze the possible moves:
- Up leads to (0, 1) which is an empty space
- Down leads to (2, 1) which is an empty space (but that's where I came from)
- Left is blocked by a wall at (1, 0)
- Right is blocked by a wall at (1, 2)

Since my goal is at (0, 2), and I need to get to the top row to reach it, I should move up to (0, 1). From there, I'll be able to move right to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), let me analyze the possible moves:
- Up is blocked by the edge of the maze
- Down leads to (1, 1) which is an empty space (but that's where I came from)
- Left is blocked by a wall at (0, 0)
- Right leads to the goal position at (0, 2)

Since my goal is at (0, 2) and it's directly to my right, I should move right to reach it.

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts from the top, goes down one side, and comes back up the other side.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "U" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 4)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form a U-shape that goes down the left side, across the bottom, and up the right side
- The player starts at the top left and needs to reach the top right
- The path is valid and traversable
- The layout is different from the original maze while maintaining the same general U-shape pattern
- The size is still 5x5
