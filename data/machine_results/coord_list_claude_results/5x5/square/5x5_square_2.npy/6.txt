You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze:
- The walls form barriers
- I need to move from current position (3, 2) to goal position (0, 2)
- I can only move through empty spaces
- I can move up, down, left, or right

Looking at my current position (3, 2):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (2, 2)
- Down leads to (3, 3) which is an empty space
- Left leads to (3, 1) which is an empty space
- Right would be (3, 3) which is an empty space

To reach the goal (0, 2), I need to eventually move upward. Since I'm blocked by walls above, I should first move to a position that will allow me to find a path around these walls.

I choose to move left to position (3, 1), as this appears to be part of a potential path that could lead to the goal.

My next move: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (3, 1):
- Up leads to (2, 1) which is an empty space
- Down leads to (3, 2) which is an empty space (where I came from)
- Left is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right leads to (3, 2) which is where I came from

Since my goal is at (0, 2), I need to work my way upward. The path up through (2, 1) is clear and appears to be the best option to eventually reach the goal.

I choose to move up to position (2, 1).

My next move: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (2, 1):
- Up leads to (1, 1) which is an empty space
- Down leads to (3, 1) which is where I came from
- Left is blocked by a wall at (2, 0)
- Right is blocked by a wall at (2, 2)

Since my goal is at (0, 2), I need to continue moving upward when possible. The path up through (1, 1) is clear and will get me closer to the goal position.

I choose to move up to position (1, 1).

My next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (1, 1):
- Up leads to (0, 1) which is an empty space
- Down leads to (2, 1) which is where I came from
- Left is blocked by a wall at (1, 0)
- Right is blocked by a wall at (1, 2)

Since my goal is at (0, 2), and I need to eventually get there, moving up to (0, 1) is the best choice. From there, I should be able to move right to reach the goal at (0, 2).

I choose to move up to position (0, 1).

My next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (0, 1):
- Up/Down movement would be outside the maze boundaries
- Left is blocked by a wall at (0, 0)
- Right leads to the goal position at (0, 2)

The goal is directly to my right at (0, 2), so this is the obvious and correct move to make.

I choose to move right to position (0, 2).

My next move: (0, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts from the right side, goes down, curves left, and then goes back up on the left side.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "U" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 0)

In this new maze:
- The U-shape is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared to the original
- The path goes up the right side, curves left at the top, and then goes down the left side
- The player starts at the bottom right and needs to reach the top left
- The walls and empty spaces are rearranged but maintain the U-shape pattern
- The maze is solvable with a clear path from P to G through the empty spaces
