You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze as follows:
- '#' represents walls
- 'P' represents player position
- 'G' represents goal
- '.' represents empty spaces

The maze would look something like this:
```
# # . . .
# # . # .
# # G . P
# # # # #
# # # # #
```

Starting from position (2, 4), I need to reach (2, 2).
The available empty spaces are (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), and (2, 3).

Looking at the possible moves from my current position (2, 4):
1. I can move left to (2, 3)

Since moving left is the only option and it brings me closer to the goal, I choose to move to (2, 3).

My next move coordinates are: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:

The maze would look something like this:
```
# # . . .
# # . # .
# # G P .
# # # # #
# # # # #
```

From my current position (2, 3), I need to reach (2, 2).
Looking at the possible moves from my current position:
1. I can move left to (2, 2), which is the goal
2. I can move right to (2, 4)

Since moving left leads directly to the goal, I choose to move to (2, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (2, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation).

2) Here's a new maze of the same 5x5 size with empty spaces forming an "L" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (4, 1)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

This maze would look like:
```
# # # P .
# # # . .
# # # . .
# . # # #
# . # # #
```

The empty spaces form an "L" shape, but it's rotated differently from the original maze. The path is still valid as the player can move from P to G through the empty spaces, and while it maintains the same general "L" shape concept, it's distinct from the original maze.
