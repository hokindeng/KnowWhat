You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current player position (P) is at (1, 3)
2. Goal (G) is at (0, 1)
3. Looking at the empty spaces and walls, I need to find a path through the empty spaces.

From my current position at (1, 3), I can see that:
- I can move up to (0, 3)
- I can move down to (2, 3)
- I can move left to (1, 2) - but this is a wall
- I can't move right as it's a wall at (1, 4)

To get closer to the goal at (0, 1), I should try to move towards the left side of the maze. The best path appears to be:
(1,3) → (0,3) → (0,2) → (0,1)

Therefore, for my next move, I choose to move up to coordinate (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), I can:
- Move left to (0, 2)
- Move down to (1, 3)
- Can't move up due to wall at (0, 4)
- Can't move right as it's outside the maze

To reach the goal at (0, 1), I need to continue moving left through the empty spaces. The path should be:
(0,3) → (0,2) → (0,1)

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), I can:
- Move left to (0, 1) - which is the goal
- Move right to (0, 3)
- Move down is not possible (wall at (1, 2))

Since I can directly reach the goal from here, I choose to move left to coordinate (0, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation). The empty spaces create a corridor that goes vertically up/down and then turns to go horizontally left/right.

2. Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different orientation and position than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 3)

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is formed by a vertical corridor going up from (4,1) to (3,1), then turning right to form a horizontal corridor from (3,1) to (3,3)
- The path from P to G is valid and follows the L-shaped corridor
- The maze has the same 5x5 dimensions as the original
- The layout is different from the original maze while maintaining the L-shape pattern
