You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze:
- The walls form a boundary and some internal obstacles
- The player (P) is at (1, 3)
- The goal (G) is at (0, 1)
- I can only move through empty spaces
- I need to reach (0, 1)

Looking at the available empty spaces and the current position (1, 3), I can move to:
- Up to (0, 3)
- Left to (1, 2)
- Down to (2, 3)

To reach the goal at (0, 1), I need to get closer to the left side of the maze. The best path would be to move up and then left through the empty spaces.

I choose to move up to coordinate (0, 3).

My next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), I can see that:
- I need to reach the goal at (0, 1)
- I can only move through empty spaces
- From (0, 3), I can move:
  * Left to (0, 2)
  * Down to (1, 3)

Since the goal is to the left at (0, 1), and I need to move through empty spaces to get there, I should move left to (0, 2).

My next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), I can:
- Move right to (0, 3)
- Move down to (1, 1) through the empty space

Since the goal is at (0, 1), and I need to get closer to it, I should move down to (1, 1) which will put me in a better position to reach the goal.

My next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 1), I can see that:
- The goal is at (0, 1), which is directly above me
- I can move:
  * Up to (0, 1) - which is the goal
  * Down to (2, 1)
  * Right to (1, 3)

Since I can directly reach the goal from here, I'll move up to (0, 1).

My next move: (0, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation).

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different orientation than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 3)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape rotated 90 degrees clockwise compared to the original
- The path from P to G is valid and traversable through empty spaces
- The maze maintains the same 5x5 size
- The walls still form a boundary around the maze
- The layout is different from the original while maintaining the "L" shape characteristic
