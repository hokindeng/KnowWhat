You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze:
- The walls form a boundary and some internal obstacles
- The player (P) is at (1, 3)
- The goal (G) is at (0, 1)
- I need to reach the goal through empty spaces

Looking at the available empty spaces and the current position (1, 3), I can move to:
- Up to (0, 3)
- Left to (1, 2)
- Down to (2, 3)

Since the goal is at (0, 1), I need to eventually move towards the left side of the maze. The best next move would be to go up to (0, 3), as this brings me closer to the goal position.

My next move is: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), I can see that:
- I need to reach the goal at (0, 1)
- I can move:
  - Left to (0, 2)
  - Down to (1, 3)

Since the goal is at (0, 1), and I need to move left to reach it, the best move is to go left to (0, 2).

My next move is: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), I can:
- Move right to (0, 3)
- Move down to (1, 1)

Since the goal is at (0, 1), and I need to move left to reach it, I should move down to (1, 1) which will allow me to eventually reach the goal.

My next move is: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 1), I can:
- Move up to (0, 1) - which is the goal
- Move down to (2, 1)

Since the goal is at (0, 1) and it's directly above my current position, I'll move up to reach it.

My next move is: (0, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Z" shape (or reversed "Z" shape, depending on orientation). The path starts from one end, makes a horizontal line, then a diagonal line, and ends with another horizontal line.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different orientation and position than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 3)

In this new maze:
- The top horizontal line of the Z is formed by (0,3) to (1,3)
- The diagonal is formed by (1,3) to (3,1)
- The bottom horizontal line is formed by (3,1) to (3,3)
- There is a valid path from P to G
- The Z shape is maintained but rotated and positioned differently from the original maze
- The overall size remains 5x5
