You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
- The walls form barriers around the maze
- The player (P) is at (3, 2)
- The goal (G) is at (3, 0)
- There are empty spaces forming a path

Looking at the possible moves from my current position (3, 2):
- Up: (2, 2) is an empty space
- Down: (4, 2) is an empty space
- Left: (3, 1) is a wall
- Right: Not provided, but likely a wall or boundary

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to move upward and then left. The first step should be to move up to (2, 2).

My next move is to position (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), I need to analyze the available moves:
- Up: Not provided, likely a wall
- Down: (3, 2) is an empty space
- Left: (2, 1) is an empty space
- Right: (2, 3) is a wall

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to move left and then down. The best move is to go left to (2, 1).

My next move is to position (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 1), I need to analyze the available moves:
- Up: Not provided, likely a wall
- Down: Not available (3, 1) is a wall
- Left: (2, 0) is an empty space
- Right: (2, 2) is an empty space

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to move left towards (2, 0) and then down to (3, 0).

My next move is to position (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 0), I need to analyze the available moves:
- Up: Not available (1, 0) is a wall
- Down: (3, 0) is the goal position
- Left: Not available (2, 1) is an empty space
- Right: Not provided, likely a wall

I can see that the goal position (3, 0) is directly below my current position, and it's accessible.

My next move is to position (3, 0), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape, with one corridor running vertically and another horizontally, meeting at a right angle.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different orientation than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (1, 1)

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is rotated 90 degrees compared to the original
- The path still forms a clear "L" shape
- The player can reach the goal by following the empty spaces
- The maze maintains the same 5x5 dimensions
- The layout is different from the original while maintaining the same general shape concept
