You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze as follows:
- '#' represents walls
- 'P' represents player position (3,2)
- 'G' represents goal position (3,0)
- '.' represents empty spaces

The maze would look something like this:
# # # # #
# # # # #
. . . # #
# P # # #
. . . # #

I need to reach (3,0) from (3,2).
Looking at the available empty spaces and considering that I can only move up, down, left, or right:
- I can see that to reach the goal (3,0), I need to go through the empty path at (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2)
- From my current position (3,2), I can move up to (2,2)

Therefore, I choose to move UP to coordinate (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3,0).

Looking at the current state:
- I'm at (2,2)
- I can move left to (2,1), which is part of the path leading to the goal
- Moving in other directions either hits walls or moves away from the goal

The optimal path to reach (3,0) is to continue moving left along the empty spaces at row 2.

Therefore, I choose to move LEFT to coordinate (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3,0).

Looking at the current state:
- I'm at (2,1)
- I can move left to (2,0), which continues the path towards the goal
- Other directions either hit walls or move away from the goal

To reach the goal at (3,0), I need to first get to (2,0) and then will be able to move down to (3,0).

Therefore, I choose to move LEFT to coordinate (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,0), I'm now adjacent to the goal position at (3,0).

Looking at the current state:
- I'm at (2,0)
- The goal is at (3,0), which is directly below my current position
- Moving in any other direction would either hit walls or move away from the goal

Since I can move down and that's where the goal is, this is the obvious choice.

Therefore, I choose to move DOWN to coordinate (3,0), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape. The vertical part of the L is formed by the spaces at (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), and (3,2), while the horizontal part is formed by (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an L shape, but rotated/flipped compared to the original:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)
Empty: (1,1), (3,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1)
Player position: (1,1)
Goal: (4,1)

In this new maze:
- The L shape is formed by empty spaces starting from the top (1,1), going down through (3,1), and then turning right through (4,1)
- The path from P to G is valid and follows the L shape
- The maze has the same 5x5 dimensions as the original
- While it maintains the L shape pattern, it's distinct from the original maze
