You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze as follows:
# # # # #
# # # # #
O O O # #
x O P # #
O O O # #

Where:
# represents walls
O represents empty spaces
P is the player position (3, 2)
G is the goal position (3, 0)

To reach the goal position (3, 0) from the current position (3, 2), I need to move towards the left and then up.

For my next move, I'll move left to position (2, 2).

Therefore, my next move is: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:

# # # # #
# # # # #
O O P # #
x O O # #
O O O # #

Where:
# represents walls
O represents empty spaces
P is the current player position (2, 2)
G is the goal position (3, 0)

To reach the goal (3, 0), I need to move up towards (2, 1) and then continue towards the goal.

Therefore, my next move is: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:

# # # # #
# # # # #
O P O # #
x O O # #
O O O # #

Where:
# represents walls
O represents empty spaces
P is the current player position (2, 1)
G is the goal position (3, 0)

To reach the goal (3, 0), I need to move up one more time to position (2, 0).

Therefore, my next move is: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:

# # # # #
# # # # #
P O O # #
x O O # #
O O O # #

Where:
# represents walls
O represents empty spaces
P is the current player position (2, 0)
G is the goal position (3, 0)

Now I can move right to reach the goal position at (3, 0).

Therefore, my next move is: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape (or an inverted "L" shape, depending on orientation).

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

This maze would look like this:
# # # # #
# O # # #
# O # # #
# P # # #
O O # # #

The empty spaces still form an "L" shape, but:
- The L is positioned differently than in the original
- The walls and paths are arranged differently
- It's still a valid maze with a solvable path from P to G
- It maintains the same 5x5 dimensions as the original
