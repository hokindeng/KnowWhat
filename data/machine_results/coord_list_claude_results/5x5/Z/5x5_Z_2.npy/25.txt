You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

The maze is 5x5, and I can visualize it like this:
- P is at (0,2)
- G is at (2,1)
- I can move through empty spaces
- I need to avoid walls
- I can move in any direction (including diagonals)

Looking at the empty spaces and considering my current position at (0,2), I can see that I need to move towards (2,1) while staying on valid paths.

From my current position at (0,2), I can move to:
- (0,1) - empty space to the left
- (0,3) - empty space to the right
- (1,2) - empty space below

The most efficient path towards the goal (2,1) would be to move to (1,2), as this brings me closer to the goal position.

I choose to move to: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1,2), I need to analyze the available moves:

Looking at the empty spaces around me:
- I can't move directly to (2,1) as it's not listed in the empty spaces
- I can move to (0,1), (0,2), or (0,3) above me
- I can move to (3,1) or (3,2) but I'd need to go through non-empty spaces

Since I can't move directly to the goal and I need to find a path through empty spaces, I should backtrack and try a different approach.

Looking at the empty spaces list, I can see that (3,1) is available, which is close to the goal. To get there, I should first move to a position that will allow me to reach it.

I'll move to: (0,1)

This will allow me to potentially find a path through the available empty spaces to reach the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,1), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at the empty spaces around me:
- I can move to (0,0) to the left
- I can move to (0,2) to the right
- I can move to (1,2) diagonally down-right

The goal is at (2,1), and I need to find a path that will lead me there through empty spaces.

Looking at the empty spaces list again:
(0,0), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)

I notice that (3,1) is available, which is close to the goal. To get there, I should try to move through the available empty spaces.

I'll move to: (0,0)

This will allow me to potentially reach (3,1) through the available empty spaces, and from there find a path to the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)

1) The empty spaces form a rough "7" shape, with:
- A horizontal line at the top (0,0 to 0,3)
- A vertical segment in the middle (1,2)
- A horizontal line at the bottom (3,0 to 3,3)

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming a "7" shape:

Walls: (0,4), (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)
Empty: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (2,0), (3,0), (3,2), (3,3)
Player position: (0,2)
Goal: (3,2)

This new maze:
- Maintains the "7" shape with a top horizontal line and bottom horizontal line
- Has a different goal position
- Has slightly different wall placements
- Preserves the same general structure while being distinct from the original
