You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position: (0, 2)
2. Goal position: (2, 1)
3. Looking at the empty spaces and walls, I need to find a path that avoids walls and stays within empty spaces.

From my current position at (0, 2), I can see that:
- I need to move towards (2, 1)
- The path will need to go through the empty spaces
- Looking at the available moves, I can move to (1, 2) which is an empty space and gets me closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to: (1, 2)

This move is:
- Legal (moves to an empty space)
- Gets me closer to the goal
- Allows for further movement towards the goal position

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 2), I need to reach the goal at (2, 1).

Looking at the available moves:
1. I can't move right as (2, 2) is a wall
2. I can't move up as (1, 1) is a wall
3. I can move diagonally down-left to (3, 1), which is an empty space
4. This diagonal move is legal and gets me closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to: (3, 1)

This move:
- Is legal (moves to an empty space)
- Gets me closer to the goal
- Will allow me to reach the goal position in the next move

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation). The empty spaces create a corridor that starts at the top, goes down vertically, and then turns to form a horizontal segment.

2. Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 1)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form a clear "L" shape
- The path goes down vertically and then turns right
- It's different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
- There is a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- The maze is the same 5x5 size as the original
