You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

The maze is 5x5, and I can visualize it like this:
- P is at (0,2)
- G is at (2,1)
- I can move through empty spaces
- I need to avoid walls
- I can move in any direction (including diagonals)

Looking at the empty spaces and considering my current position at (0,2), I can see that I need to move towards (2,1) while staying on valid paths.

From my current position at (0,2), I can move to:
- (0,1) - empty space to the left
- (0,3) - empty space to the right
- (1,2) - empty space below

The most efficient path towards the goal (2,1) would be to move to (1,2), as this brings me closer to the goal position.

I choose to move to: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1,2), I need to analyze the available moves:

Looking at the empty spaces around me:
- I can't move directly to (2,1) as it's not listed in the empty spaces
- I can move to (0,1), (0,2), or (0,3) above me
- I can move to (3,1) or (3,2) but I'd need to go through non-empty spaces

Looking at the goal at (2,1), I need to find a path that will eventually lead me there.

The best approach seems to be to move to (0,1), as this will allow me to potentially find a path to (2,1) through the available empty spaces.

I choose to move to: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,1), I need to analyze the available moves:

Looking at the empty spaces around me:
- I can move to (0,0) to the left
- I can move to (0,2) to the right
- I can move to (1,2) diagonally down-right

Since my goal is at (2,1), and I need to find a way to get there through empty spaces, I notice that I can use the empty spaces at (3,1) as part of my path.

The most strategic move would be to go to (0,0), as this could potentially allow me to reach (3,1) and then work my way to (2,1).

I choose to move to: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,0), I need to analyze the available moves:

Looking at the empty spaces around me:
- I can move to (0,1) to the right
- I can move to (3,0) which is further down
- I can move to (3,1) diagonally down-right

Since my goal is at (2,1), and I can see that (3,1) is an empty space that's closer to my goal, moving there would be beneficial. Even though (3,1) seems far, diagonal moves are allowed and I can reach it in one move.

I choose to move to: (3,1)

This diagonal move will get me much closer to the goal position at (2,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

1) The empty spaces form a rough "L" shape, with one horizontal corridor along the top row (0,0 to 0,3) and one vertical corridor on the right side (3,0 to 3,3), connected by a small passage at (1,2).

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 2)

In this new maze:
- The top horizontal corridor runs along (0,0) to (0,3)
- The vertical corridor runs along (3,0) to (3,3)
- The corridors are connected through (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)
- The shape is still recognizably an "L", but rotated and slightly modified from the original
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
