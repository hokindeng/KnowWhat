You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
- The walls form a border on the left side and bottom of the maze, with some internal walls
- The current player position (P) is at (3, 4)
- The goal (G) is at (2, 2)
- I need to reach (2, 2) through empty spaces

Looking at the available empty spaces and the current position (3, 4), I can see that:
1. I can move to empty spaces at (3, 3) which is directly to my left
2. This would be a good first step as it brings me closer to the goal at (2, 2)

Therefore, I choose to move to (3, 3).

My next move coordinates are: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I can see that:
1. I need to reach the goal at (2, 2)
2. I can move to empty space (3, 2) which is directly to my left
3. This move will bring me closer to the goal

Moving to (3, 2) is the best choice as it continues my path toward the goal position.

My next move coordinates are: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I can see that:
1. The goal is at (2, 2), which is directly above my current position
2. Moving up to (2, 2) is a valid move since it's not a wall position

Since I can reach the goal directly from here, I'll move to (2, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (2, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation). The empty spaces create a corridor that runs along the top of the maze and then turns downward on the right side.

2. Here's a new 5x5 maze that maintains an "L" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 2)

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is formed by a vertical corridor on the right side and a horizontal corridor at the top
- The player can move from P to G through the empty spaces
- The shape is similar to the original but mirrored and slightly shifted
- The maze maintains the same 5x5 dimensions as the original
