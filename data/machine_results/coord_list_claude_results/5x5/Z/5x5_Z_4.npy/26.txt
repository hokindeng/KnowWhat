You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position: (3, 4)
2. Goal position: (2, 2)
3. Looking at the walls and empty spaces, I need to find a path through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

From my current position at (3, 4), I can see that:
- I need to move towards the goal which is up and to the left
- I can move to empty spaces at (3, 3)
- Moving to (3, 3) will get me closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I can see that:
- The goal is at (2, 2), which is up and to the left from my position
- I can move to empty spaces at (3, 2)
- Moving to (3, 2) will get me closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I can see that:
- The goal is at (2, 2), which is directly up from my position
- Since (2, 2) is not listed in the walls and must be an empty space (since it's the goal), I can move there directly
- This will complete the path to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation). The corridors run along the top edge and then down the right side of the maze.

2. Here's a new 5x5 maze that maintains an "L" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (4, 1)

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is rotated 90 degrees compared to the original
- The empty spaces form a corridor that runs down the right side and then turns left at the bottom
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The overall dimensions remain 5x5
- The shape is clearly recognizable as an "L"
