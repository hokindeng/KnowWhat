You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze where:
- '#' represents walls
- '.' represents empty spaces
- 'P' represents player position (4,4)
- 'G' represents goal position (2,3)

The maze would look something like this:
# # # # #
# . . . .
# # # . #
# # . # #
# . . . P

The goal is at (2,3), and I'm currently at (4,4).
I need to move towards the goal while staying on empty spaces.

Looking at the available empty spaces and considering the shortest path, I should move diagonally up-left to position (3,3).

My next move: (3,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Let me analyze this.

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze:
```
# # # # #
# . . . .
# # # . #
# # . # #
# . . . P
```
The empty spaces (corridors) form a rough "Z" shape, starting from the top right, going horizontally left, then diagonally down-right, and finally horizontally left again.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (1, 1)

This would look like:
```
# # # # #
# G . . #
# . . # #
# # . . #
# # # . P
```

The empty spaces still form a "Z" shape, but with a different orientation and the start/end points are different. The path is still valid and traversable from P to G.
