You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From what I understand:
1. I'm at position (0, 3)
2. I need to reach (4, 1)
3. I can move in any direction (including diagonals) through empty spaces
4. I need to avoid walls

Looking at the available empty spaces and considering the goal position, I can see that I need to move towards the bottom of the maze to eventually reach (4, 1).

From my current position (0, 3), I can see that moving to (1, 3) is a valid move because:
1. It's adjacent to my current position
2. It's in the list of empty spaces
3. It moves me closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 3), I need to analyze the available moves.

Looking at the empty spaces and considering my goal at (4, 1), I can see that:
1. I need to continue moving downward and slightly to the left to reach the goal
2. I can move to (2, 2) which is:
   - Diagonally accessible from my current position
   - Listed in the empty spaces
   - A step in the right direction towards the goal
3. This move will help me avoid the walls around me

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), I need to analyze the available moves.

Looking at the empty spaces and considering my goal at (4, 1), I can see that:
1. I need to continue moving downward and slightly to the left to reach the goal
2. I can move to (3, 1) which is:
   - Diagonally accessible from my current position
   - Listed in the empty spaces
   - A step in the right direction towards the goal
   - Gets me very close to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), I need to analyze the available moves.

Looking at the empty spaces and considering my goal at (4, 1):
1. I'm now just one step away from the goal
2. The goal position (4, 1) is directly below my current position
3. Moving to (4, 1) is:
   - Vertically adjacent to my current position
   - Will complete the maze

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 1), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "S" shape. The path starts at the top, curves to the right, then curves back to the left as it goes down, creating an "S" pattern.

2. Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an "S" shape, but with a different arrangement than the original:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 2)

In this new maze:
- The "S" shape starts at the top left
- Curves to the right in the middle
- Then curves back to the left at the bottom
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Has a different wall arrangement but maintains the "S" shape of the corridors
- Is the same 5x5 size as the original
