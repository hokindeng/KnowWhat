You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze:
- The player (P) is at (2, 2)
- The goal (G) is at (2, 0)
- I need to find a path through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around the current position (2, 2), I can see that:
1. The goal is above and to the left of the current position
2. There are walls blocking many direct paths
3. I need to find a path through the empty spaces to reach (2, 0)

From position (2, 2), I can see that moving to (3, 1) would be a good step because:
1. It's an empty space (listed in the Empty coordinates)
2. It brings me closer to the goal
3. It avoids walls
4. It will allow me to eventually reach the goal through the empty spaces

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position:
1. I can move to (3, 0)
2. The goal is at (2, 0), which is one step up from (3, 0)

The best move would be to (3, 0) because:
1. It's an empty space (listed in the Empty coordinates)
2. It brings me closer to the goal
3. From there, I can reach the goal position in one more move

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 0), I can now move directly to the goal at (2, 0).

The move to (2, 0) is possible because:
1. It's adjacent to my current position
2. It's the goal position
3. There are no walls blocking this move

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (2, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a "7" shape (or reversed "L" shape). The path starts at the top row, extends across horizontally, and then has a vertical segment coming down on the left side.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "7" shape:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (4, 0)

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 size as the original
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze
- Forms a "7" shape with its empty spaces: there's a horizontal corridor along the top row and a vertical corridor down the left side
- The player can move from start to goal by following this "7" shaped path
