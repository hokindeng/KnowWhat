You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze:
- The player (P) is at (2, 2)
- The goal (G) is at (2, 0)
- I need to reach the goal while moving through empty spaces

Looking at the available empty spaces around the current position (2, 2):
1. I can see that I need to move towards the left side of the maze to reach (2, 0)
2. The direct path to the left is blocked by walls
3. I need to find a path through the empty spaces

Looking at the empty spaces near my current position, I can move diagonally to (1, 3), which is an empty space and will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces around my current position (1, 3):
1. I can move to (0, 3), which is an empty space
2. I can move to (0, 2), which is an empty space
3. The goal is to the bottom left of my current position

The best strategy would be to move towards the left side of the maze and then down to reach the goal. Moving to (0, 2) would get me closer to creating a path to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces around my current position (0, 2):
1. I can move to (0, 1), which is an empty space
2. I can move to (0, 3), which is an empty space

Since the goal is at (2, 0), I need to move towards the left and then down. Moving to (0, 1) would get me closer to creating a path to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces around my current position (0, 1):
1. I can move to (0, 0), which is an empty space
2. I can move to (0, 2), which is an empty space

Since the goal is at (2, 0), I need to move towards the left and then down. Moving to (0, 0) would get me closer to creating a path to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces around my current position (0, 0):
1. I can move to (1, 0), which is an empty space
2. I can move to (0, 1), which is an empty space

Since the goal is at (2, 0), I need to move down along the leftmost column. Moving to (1, 0) would get me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (1, 0).

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), I need to make my final move towards the goal at (2, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces around my current position (1, 0):
1. I can move to (2, 0), which is the goal position
2. I can move back to (0, 0), which isn't helpful

Since I can directly reach the goal from here, I'll move to (2, 0).

I choose to move to coordinates (2, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape, with one corridor running along the top row and another corridor running down the leftmost column.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (5x5) that maintains an "L" shaped corridor pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (4, 0)

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is more pronounced and regular
- The horizontal part of the "L" runs along (0,0) to (0,2)
- The vertical part of the "L" runs down the leftmost column from (0,0) to (4,0)
- There's a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The overall shape is similar to the original but with a cleaner, more defined "L" pattern
