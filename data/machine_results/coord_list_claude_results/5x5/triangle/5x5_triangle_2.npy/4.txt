You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze:
- The player (P) is at (2, 2)
- The goal (G) is at (2, 0)
- I need to reach the goal while moving through empty spaces

Looking at the available empty spaces around the current position (2, 2):
1. I can see that I need to move towards the left side of the maze to reach (2, 0)
2. The direct path to the left is blocked by walls
3. I need to find a path through the empty spaces

Looking at the empty spaces near my current position, I can move diagonally to (3, 1), which is an empty space and gets me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move will be to: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the path to the goal.

From my current position at (3, 1), I can see that:
1. The goal is at (2, 0)
2. I need to move towards the upper-left direction
3. Looking at the available empty spaces, I can move to (3, 0)

Moving to (3, 0) will get me closer to the goal, and from there I'll be able to make the final move to reach the goal position.

Therefore, my next move will be to: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 0), I can now move directly to the goal position at (2, 0).

The space at (2, 0) is not marked as a wall and will complete the path to the goal.

Therefore, my next move will be to: (2, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape, with one corridor running along the top row and another running down the left side of the maze.

2. Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement than the original:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (0, 2)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape
- One corridor runs along the bottom (x-axis)
- One corridor runs up the right side (y-axis)
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The layout is different from the original maze while maintaining the same general "L" shape pattern
