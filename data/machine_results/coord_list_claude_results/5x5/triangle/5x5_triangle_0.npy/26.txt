You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the optimal path from the player position (4,3) to the goal (3,1).

Looking at the given coordinates:
- I'm currently at (4,3)
- The goal is at (3,1)
- I can move through empty spaces and need to avoid walls
- I can move in any direction (including diagonals)

From my current position at (4,3), I can see that I need to move towards the goal which is up and to the left. Looking at the available empty spaces, I can move to (3,3) as my next position, which will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to (3,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3,1). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering the walls, I can see that I can move to (2,3) as my next step, which will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3,1). Looking at the available empty spaces, I can move to (2,2), which will help me get closer to the goal position.

I choose to move to (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,2), I need to reach the goal at (3,1). Looking at the available moves and considering that (3,1) is the goal position, I can move directly to it since it's adjacent to my current position (diagonally).

I choose to move to (3,1), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "7" shape (or reversed "L" shape). The path starts from the bottom, goes up, and then makes a horizontal segment towards the left.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming a "7" shape, but with a different arrangement than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the "7" runs along coordinates (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1)
- The horizontal part runs along (3,0), (4,0)
- The path is still navigable from P to G
- The shape is still recognizable as a "7" but is positioned differently than in the original maze
