You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze where:
- '#' represents walls
- '.' represents empty spaces
- 'P' represents player position
- 'G' represents goal

The maze would look something like this:
```
#####
###.#
##.##
#.#.#
...P#
```
where the goal (G) is at (3,1).

From my current position at (4,3), I need to reach (3,1). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering that I can move in any direction (including diagonals), I should move towards the goal while staying on empty spaces.

The best next move would be to (3,3), moving one step up. This keeps me on an empty space and gets me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (3,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3,1).

Looking at the available empty spaces and considering the layout:
```
#####
###.#
##.##
#.P.#
....#
```

I can see that to reach the goal at (3,1), I need to move through the empty spaces. From my current position at (3,3), I can move to (2,3) which is an empty space and gets me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3,1).

Looking at the available empty spaces and considering the layout:
```
#####
###.#
##.P#
#.#.#
....#
```

From my current position at (2,3), I can move to (2,2) which is an empty space and gets me closer to the goal. This diagonal movement will help me progress towards the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,2), I need to reach the goal at (3,1).

Looking at the available empty spaces and considering the layout:
```
#####
###.#
##P##
#.#.#
....#
```

From my current position at (2,2), I can move directly to (3,1), which is the goal position. This is a valid diagonal move to an empty space that will complete the maze.

I choose to move to coordinates (3,1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), starting from the bottom left, moving up diagonally to the middle, and then continuing diagonally to the upper portion.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different arrangement than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

This maze would look like:
```
#####
#G###
#.###
#.###
..P##
```

The empty spaces still form a "Z" shape, but it's more compact than the original. The path starts at the bottom, moves up diagonally through the middle, and reaches the goal at the top, maintaining the essential "Z" characteristic while being distinct from the original maze.
