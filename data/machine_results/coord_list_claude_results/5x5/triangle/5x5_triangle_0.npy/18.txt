You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze where:
- '#' represents walls
- '.' represents empty spaces
- 'P' represents player position
- 'G' represents goal

The maze would look something like this:
```
#####
###.#
##.##
#.#.#
...P#
```
where I'm at (4,3) and need to reach (3,1).

Looking at the possible moves from my current position (4,3):
1. I can move up to (3,3)
2. I can move diagonally up-left to (3,2)
3. I can move left to (4,2)

Since the goal is at (3,1), and I need to move generally upward and leftward, the best move would be to move left to (4,2), which will give me more options to reach the goal.

I choose to move to (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,2), let me analyze the possible moves:

The maze looks like this:
```
#####
###.#
##.##
#.#.#
..P.#
```

From (4,2), I can move:
1. Left to (4,1)
2. Up to (3,2) - but this is a wall
3. Up-left diagonally to (3,1) - this is the goal!
4. Right to (4,3)

Since I can directly reach the goal position (3,1) with a diagonal move up-left, and this position is marked as empty (since it's the goal), this is clearly the best move.

I choose to move to (3,1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), starting from the bottom left, moving right, then diagonally up-left, and then right again at the top.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with a "Z" shaped path:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (1, 1)

This maze would look like this:
```
#####
#G###
#.###
#.###
P..##
```

The empty spaces still form a "Z" shape, but it's a different configuration from the original. The path goes from bottom left, moves right briefly, then diagonally up-left, and then right at the top to reach the goal. This maintains the essential "Z" shape while being distinct from the original maze.
