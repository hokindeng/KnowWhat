You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the optimal path from the player position (4,4) to the goal (2,3).

Looking at the given coordinates:
- I'm currently at (4,4)
- The goal is at (2,3)
- I can move through empty spaces, including diagonally
- I need to avoid walls

From my current position at (4,4), I can see that I need to move towards the goal which is up and slightly to the left. Looking at the empty spaces available, I can move to (3,4) as my next position.

My next move: (3,4)

This is a safe move because:
1. (3,4) is listed in the empty spaces
2. It's adjacent to my current position
3. It moves me closer to the goal

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2,3).

Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my options:
1. I can see that (3,2) is an empty space
2. Moving to (3,2) would get me closer to the goal
3. (3,2) is accessible from my current position
4. From there, I'll be in a better position to reach the goal at (2,3)

Therefore, my next move will be: (3,2)

This move:
- Is to a valid empty space
- Brings me closer to the goal
- Avoids walls
- Maintains a path to eventually reach the goal

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)), they form a rough "7" shape when connected. The vertical part of the "7" runs down the right side at x=4, and the horizontal part extends left around y=2.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze that also forms a "7" shape but with a slightly different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the "7" runs along x=3
- The horizontal part extends left around y=3
- There's a valid path from P to G
- The shape is still recognizable as a "7"
- The layout is different from the original while maintaining the same general shape
