You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the optimal path from the player position (4,4) to the goal (2,3).

Looking at the given coordinates:
- I'm currently at (4,4)
- The goal is at (2,3)
- I can move through empty spaces, including diagonally
- I need to avoid walls

From my current position at (4,4), I can see that:
1. I can move to (3,4) which is an empty space
2. This would bring me closer to the goal at (2,3)

Therefore, I choose to move to (3,4) as my next move.

My next move coordinates are: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2,3).

Looking at my options:
1. I can move to (2,4) which is an empty space
2. I can move to (3,2) which is an empty space
3. Moving to (2,4) would keep me closer to the goal at (2,3)

Therefore, I choose to move to (2,4) as my next move.

My next move coordinates are: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,4), I need to reach the goal at (2,3).

Looking at my options:
1. I can move directly to (2,3), which is the goal position
2. This is a valid move since it's adjacent to my current position

Therefore, I choose to move to (2,3), which will complete the maze.

My next move coordinates are: (2,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation). The path starts from the bottom right, goes up, and then turns left towards the goal.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is formed by a vertical corridor going up from the bottom, and then turning right
- The player starts at the bottom of the "L"
- The goal is at the end of the horizontal part of the "L"
- The path is still navigable while maintaining the "L" shape
- The maze has different wall placements but maintains the same overall size as the original
