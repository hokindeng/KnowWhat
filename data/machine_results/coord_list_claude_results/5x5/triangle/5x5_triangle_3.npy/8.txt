You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the optimal path from the player position (4,4) to the goal (2,3).

Looking at the given coordinates:
- I'm currently at (4,4)
- The goal is at (2,3)
- I can move through empty spaces, including diagonally
- I need to avoid walls

From my current position at (4,4), I can see that I need to move generally northwest to reach the goal. Looking at the empty spaces available, I can move to (3,4) as my first step, which will bring me closer to the goal while staying on a valid path.

My next move should be to: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2,3).

Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my goal:
- I can move to (3,2) which is empty
- I can move to (2,4) which is empty
- The goal is at (2,3)

Since the goal is at (2,3), and I need to get closer to it, moving to (3,2) would be a good step as it brings me closer to the goal position. From there, I'll be able to reach (2,3) in the next move.

My next move should be to: (3,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape (or reversed "7" shape), with one corridor running vertically and another horizontally, meeting at a right angle.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 0)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape
- The path runs vertically from (4,0) to (3,3), then horizontally to (1,3)
- It's different from the original maze but maintains the same basic "L" shape concept
- There is a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- The maze is still 5x5 in size
