You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze as follows:
# = wall
. = empty space
P = player
G = goal

#####
#.#.#
...P#
#####
#####

The player is at (2, 4) and needs to reach (2, 0).
Looking at the available empty spaces and considering that diagonal moves are allowed, I can see that I need to move towards the left side of the maze.

The best next move would be to (2, 3), which is directly to the left of the current position. This keeps us on the path while moving closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

#####

I'm now at (2, 3) and need to reach (2, 0).
The best path continues to the left through the available empty spaces.

I choose to move to (2, 2), which is directly to the left of my current position. This keeps me on the path toward the goal.

My next move is to coordinates (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4)

I choose to move to (2, 1), which is directly to the left of my current position. This keeps me on the path toward the goal.

My next move is to coordinates (2, 1).

I'm now at (2, 1) and need to reach (2, 0).
I'm just one step away from the goal position.

I choose to move to (2, 0), which is directly to the left of my current position. This will take me to the goal.

My next move is to coordinates (2, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) In the original maze, the empty spaces form a horizontal "Z" shape (or reversed "Z" shape, depending on perspective). The path starts at one end, makes a diagonal line through the middle, and ends at the other end.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with a similar "Z" shape pattern, but mirrored vertically compared to the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 0)

This maze would look like:
#####
#.#.#
#.#.#
#.#P#
#####

The empty spaces still form a "Z" shape, but now it's positioned in the middle rows of the maze rather than across a single row. The player can move diagonally through the empty spaces to reach the goal, following the Z pattern.
