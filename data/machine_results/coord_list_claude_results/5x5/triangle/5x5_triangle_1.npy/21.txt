You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the optimal path from the player position (2,4) to the goal (2,0).

Looking at the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze:
# represents walls
. represents empty spaces
P represents player
G represents goal

#####
#.#.#
...G.
#####
#####

Current position: (2,4)
Goal position: (2,0)

I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal. Looking at the available empty spaces and considering that I can move in any direction (including diagonals), I can see that I need to move towards the left to reach the goal.

The next logical move would be to (2,3), which is an empty space directly to the left of the current position.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state of the maze:

I need to continue moving left through the empty spaces to reach the goal. The next logical move would be to (2,2), which is an empty space directly to the left of my current position.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4)

I need to continue moving left through the empty spaces to reach the goal. The next logical move would be to (2,1), which is an empty space directly to the left of my current position.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state of the maze:

I'm now just one step away from the goal. The next and final move would be to (2,0), which is the goal position directly to the left of my current position.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) In the original maze, the empty spaces form a horizontal "Z" shape (or reversed "Z" shape, depending on perspective). The path starts at one end, makes a diagonal movement through the middle, and ends at the opposite end.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming a Z shape, but with a different arrangement than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 4), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal position: (3, 0)

This maze would look like this:
####P
#.#.#
#..##
G..##
#####

The empty spaces still form a Z shape, but it's oriented differently from the original maze. The path still requires moving through a diagonal middle section to connect the two horizontal ends of the Z.
