You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the path from the player position (4,0) to the goal (2,0).

Looking at the given coordinates:
- I'm currently at (4,0)
- The goal is at (2,0)
- The empty spaces are at (2,2), (3,1), and (4,2)
- I need to avoid all wall coordinates

From my current position at (4,0), I can see that I need to move upward to reach the goal at (2,0). Looking at the available moves, I can move to (3,1), which is an empty space and will get me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move will be to: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,1), I need to reach the goal at (2,0).

Looking at the available moves:
- I can't move directly to (2,0) yet as I need to avoid walls
- I can move diagonally up-left to (2,0), which is exactly where the goal is!

Therefore, my next move will be to: (2,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((2,2), (3,1), (4,0), (4,2)), they form a rough "Z" shape when connected.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (3,0), (3,1), (3,3), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)
Empty: (1,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,3), (4,4)
Player position: (1,1)
Goal: (4,4)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form a "Z" that starts from the top-left area and ends at the bottom-right
- The path is valid and traversable from P to G
- The maze maintains the same 5x5 dimensions
- The "Z" shape is more pronounced than in the original but maintains the same basic concept of a diagonal line with horizontal connections
