You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze as follows:
# # # # #
# # # # #
# # P # E
# # # E #
# # E # G

Where:
# represents walls
E represents empty spaces
P is the player position (2,2)
G is the goal (4,4)

Looking at the available paths:
1. I'm at (2,2)
2. I need to reach (4,4)
3. I can see that I need to move through the empty spaces to reach the goal
4. The most direct path would be to move diagonally to (3,3), which is an empty space

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
# # # # #
# # # # #
# # E # E
# # # P #
# # E # G

I'm now at (3,3) and need to reach (4,4).
From my current position, I can move diagonally to reach the goal at (4,4).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4,4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((2,2), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (4,4)), they form a zigzag or Z-shape pattern.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with a Z-shaped path:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)
Empty: (1,1), (2,1), (3,3), (4,4)
Player position: (0,0)
Goal: (4,4)

When visualized:
P # # # #
# E # # #
# E # # #
# # # E #
# # # # G

The empty spaces still form a Z-shape, but the path is different from the original maze while maintaining the same general pattern of a diagonal line connecting two horizontal segments.
