You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze as follows:
# # # # #
# # # # #
# # P # E
# # # E #
# # E # G

Where:
# represents walls
E represents empty spaces
P is the player position (2,2)
G is the goal (4,4)

Looking at the possible moves from position (2,2):
1. I can move to (3,3) which is an empty space
2. I can move to (4,2) which is an empty space
3. I can move to (2,4) which is an empty space

Since the goal is at (4,4), moving to (3,3) would be the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:

# # # # #
# # # # #
# # E # E
# # # P #
# # E # G

From my current position at (3,3), I can move to:
1. (2,2) - empty space
2. (2,4) - empty space
3. (4,2) - empty space
4. (4,4) - the goal

Since I can reach the goal (4,4) directly from my current position with a diagonal move, I'll choose to move to (4,4).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4,4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a "Z" shape. Starting from (2,2), going to (3,3), and ending at (4,4), with additional spaces at (2,4) and (4,2) that form the characteristic angles of the letter Z.

2. Here's a new 5x5 maze that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,0), (2,2), (2,4), (3,0), (3,2), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,4)
Empty: (1,1), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3)
Player position: (1,1)
Goal: (4,3)

This new maze creates a Z-shaped corridor where:
- The top of the Z starts at (1,1)
- The diagonal part of the Z goes through (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3)
- The bottom of the Z ends at (4,3)

The path is different from the original but maintains the recognizable Z shape when looking at the empty spaces, and provides a valid path from P to G.
