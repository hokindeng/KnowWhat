You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

Based on the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
# # # # #
# P # G #
# # # # #
# . # . #
# # # # #

Where:
# represents walls
P is the player position (1,1)
G is the goal position (1,3)
. represents empty spaces

Looking at the available moves from position (1,1), I can see that:
- I can move to (2,2), which is an empty space
- From there, I can move to (1,3), which is the goal

For my first move, I choose to move to coordinate (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,2), I can now move directly to the goal at (1,3).

I choose to move to coordinate (1,3).

This should complete the maze as we will have reached the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((1,1), (2,2), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3)), they form a "Z" shape when connected.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with different positioning:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,0), (2,2), (2,4), (3,0), (3,1), (3,3), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)
Empty: (1,1), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)
Player position: (1,1)
Goal: (3,2)

This creates a Z-shaped path where:
- The top of the Z starts at (1,1)
- The diagonal part goes through (2,1) and (2,3)
- The bottom of the Z ends at (3,2)

The path is valid as the player can move from P to G through connected empty spaces, and the Z shape is clearly visible but different from the original maze's configuration.
