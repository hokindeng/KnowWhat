You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

Based on the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
# # # # #
# P # G #
# # # # #
# . # . #
# # # # #

Where:
# represents walls
P is the player position (1,1)
G is the goal (1,3)
. represents empty spaces

Looking at the available paths:
1. The player is at (1,1)
2. The goal is at (1,3)
3. There are empty spaces at (2,2), (3,1), and (3,3)

To reach the goal at (1,3), I need to find a path through the empty spaces. I can move to any adjacent space, including diagonals.

From my current position at (1,1), I can move to (2,2), which is an empty space. This will get me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move should be to: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:

The maze now looks like:
# # # # #
# . # G #
# # P # #
# . # . #
# # # # #

Where:
# represents walls
P is the player position (2,2)
G is the goal (1,3)
. represents empty spaces

From my current position at (2,2), I can move to (1,3), which is the goal position. This is a valid diagonal move to the northeast.

Therefore, my next move should be to: (1,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((1,1), (2,2), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3)), they form a general "X" or "cross" shape.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an X shape:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,2), (1,4), (2,0), (2,2), (2,4), (3,0), (3,2), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)
Empty: (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)
Player position: (1,1)
Goal: (3,3)

This maze:
- Maintains the 5x5 size
- Has empty spaces forming an X shape
- Has a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- Is different from the original (different P and G positions, slightly different wall arrangement)
- The empty spaces still form a recognizable X pattern, with the center at (2,2) and the four corners at (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), and (3,3)

Visualized:
# # # # #
# P # . #
# # . # #
# . # . #
# # # # #

Where P is at (1,1) and G is at (3,3)
