You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

Based on the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
# # # # #
# P # G #
# # # # #
# . # . #
# # # # #

Where:
# represents walls
P is the player position (1,1)
G is the goal (1,3)
. represents empty spaces

Looking at the available paths:
1. The player is at (1,1)
2. The goal is at (1,3)
3. There are empty spaces at (2,2), (3,1), and (3,3)

To reach the goal at (1,3), I need to find a path through the empty spaces. I can see that I can move diagonally down-right to (2,2) as my first move, which will then allow me to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,2), I can now move diagonally up-right to reach the goal at (1,3).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1,3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((1,1), (2,2), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3)), they form a Z shape or zigzag pattern.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming a Z shape:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,2), (1,4), (2,0), (2,2), (2,4), (3,0), (3,2), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)
Empty: (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3)
Player position: (1,1)
Goal: (3,3)

This maze:
- Maintains the 5x5 size
- Creates a clear Z pattern with its empty spaces
- Provides a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
- The Z shape can be traced by following the empty spaces from top-left to bottom-right

When visualized, it would look something like this:
# # # # #
# P # . #
# . # . #
# . # . #
# # # # #

Where the empty spaces form a more pronounced Z pattern than the original maze while still maintaining playability.
