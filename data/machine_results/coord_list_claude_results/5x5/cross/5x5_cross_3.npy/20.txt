You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as follows:
# # # # #
# # # # #
# P # # #
# # # # #
# G # # #

Where:
# represents walls
P is the player position (2,1)
G is the goal position (4,1)
Empty spaces are at (2,3), (3,2), and (4,3)

To reach the goal at (4,1), I need to find a path through the empty spaces.

Looking at the possible moves from my current position (2,1):
- I can move to (3,2) which is an empty space and gets me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:

From my current position at (3,2), I need to reach the goal at (4,1).

Looking at the possible moves from (3,2):
- I can move diagonally to (4,1), which is the goal position
- I can move to (2,3) or (4,3), but these would take me further from the goal

Since I can move diagonally and (4,1) is directly accessible from my current position, I choose to move to coordinate (4,1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((2,1), (3,2), (4,1), (2,3), (4,3)), they form a "Z" shape when connected.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (3,0), (3,1), (3,3), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,3), (4,4)
Empty: (1,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)
Player position: (0,1)
Goal: (4,2)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form a "Z" shape from top-left to bottom-right
- The path is valid (you can move from P to G through empty spaces)
- The arrangement is different from the original maze
- The "Z" shape is clearly recognizable when the empty spaces are connected
