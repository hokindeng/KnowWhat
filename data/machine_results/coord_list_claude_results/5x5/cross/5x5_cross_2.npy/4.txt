You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze where:
- '#' represents walls
- 'P' represents player position (3,4)
- 'G' represents goal position (1,2)
- '.' represents empty spaces

The maze would look something like this:
#####
##.#.
###.#
##.#P
#####

I need to get from (3,4) to (1,2).
Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (1,4)
- (2,3)
- (3,2)

To reach the goal at (1,2), I need to move through the available empty spaces. From my current position at (3,4), I can move to (2,3), which is an empty space and would get me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

The maze would look something like this:
#####
##.#.
###P#
##.#.
#####

I'm now at (2,3) and need to reach (1,2).
Available empty spaces are:
- (1,4)
- (3,2)
- (3,4)

From my current position at (2,3), I can move to (3,2), which is an empty space and would help me get closer to the goal position by creating a path towards (1,2).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

The maze would look something like this:
#####
##.#.
###.#
##P#.
#####

I'm now at (3,2) and need to reach (1,2).
Available empty spaces are:
- (1,4)
- (2,3)
- (3,4)

From my current position at (3,2), I can move to (2,3), which is an empty space. Although this means backtracking to where I was before, it's necessary because I need to find a different path to reach (1,2).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

The maze would look something like this:
#####
##.#.
###P#
##.#.
#####

I'm now at (2,3) and need to reach (1,2).
Available empty spaces are:
- (1,4)
- (3,2)
- (3,4)

From my current position at (2,3), I can move to (1,4), which is an empty space. This will get me to the top row where the goal is, and from there I might be able to reach (1,2).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

The maze would look something like this:
#####
##.#P
###.#
##.#.
#####

I'm now at (1,4) and need to reach (1,2).
Available empty spaces are:
- (2,3)
- (3,2)
- (3,4)

From my current position at (1,4), I can move to (1,2), which is the goal position! Since diagonal moves are allowed, I can move directly to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (3,4)), they form a "Z" shape when connected. The path from P to G uses this Z-shaped corridor.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with a Z-shaped corridor, but with different wall placements:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (2,4), (3,1), (3,3), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)

Empty: (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)

Player position: (1,4)
Goal: (3,0)

This maze would look like:
#####
##.#P
#.#.#
..#.#
#####

The empty spaces still form a Z shape, but it's oriented differently from the original maze. The path from P to G is still valid through the Z-shaped corridor, but the specific wall placements and the start/end positions are different from the original maze.
