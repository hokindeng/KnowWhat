You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the player and the goal.

The initial maze is:
```
0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

From the maze, we can see:
- The player (P) is at coordinates (0, 3).
- The goal (G) is at coordinates (2, 3).

We need to find a path from (0, 3) to (2, 3). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (0, 3):

1. Move up to (0, 2) - Not possible (out of bounds).
2. Move down to (1, 3) - Not possible (wall).
3. Move left to (0, 2) - Possible (empty space).
4. Move right to (0, 4) - Possible (empty space).

Let's move right to (0, 4).

The updated maze is:
```
0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

The new coordinates of the player are (0, 4). Please provide the coordinates of your next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 4), let's consider the possible moves:

1. Move up to (-1, 4) - Not possible (out of bounds).
2. Move down to (1, 4) - Not possible (wall).
3. Move left to (0, 3) - Possible (empty space).
4. Move right to (0, 5) - Not possible (out of bounds).

The only possible move is to move left to (0, 3).

The updated maze is:
```
0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

The new coordinates of the player are (0, 3). Please provide the coordinates of your next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), let's consider the possible moves again:

1. Move up to (-1, 3) - Not possible (out of bounds).
2. Move down to (1, 3) - Not possible (wall).
3. Move left to (0, 2) - Possible (empty space).
4. Move right to (0, 4) - Possible (empty space).

Since moving right to (0, 4) brings us back to the previous position, let's move left to (0, 2).

The updated maze is:
```
0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

3. Move left to (0, 1) - Possible (empty space).
4. Move right to (0, 3) - Possible (empty space).

Since moving right to (0, 3) brings us back to the previous position, let's move left to (0, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape".

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a U-shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and it is not an identical copy of the original maze:

```
P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player (P) starts at the top left corner (0, 0).
- The goal (G) is at the bottom right corner (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form a U-shape, similar to the original maze.
