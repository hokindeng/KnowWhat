You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G) while avoiding walls. Let's start by identifying the current position of the player and the goal:

Current player position (P): (0, 3)
Goal position (G): (2, 3)

We can move to any adjacent empty space (0) in the up, down, left, or right direction. Let's find the next move:

From (0, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 3) - Wall (1)
- Left: (0, 2) - Empty space (0)
- Right: (0, 4) - Empty space (0)

Since moving down is not possible due to the wall, and moving up is out of bounds, we can either move left or right. Moving right seems to be a better option as it brings us closer to the goal.

Next move: (0, 4)

Please update the maze and provide the new configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's evaluate the current position and possible moves again:

Current player position (P): (0, 4)
Goal position (G): (2, 3)

From (0, 4), the possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 4) - Wall (1)
- Left: (0, 3) - Empty space (0)
- Right: Not possible (out of bounds)

Since moving up and right are out of bounds, and moving down is blocked by a wall, the only possible move is to the left.

Next move: (0, 3)

Please update the maze and provide the new configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems we have returned to the previous position. Let's re-evaluate the situation and find a different path to the goal.

Current player position (P): (0, 3)
Goal position (G): (2, 3)

From (0, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 3) - Wall (1)
- Left: (0, 2) - Empty space (0)
- Right: (0, 4) - Empty space (0)

Since moving down is not possible due to the wall, and moving up is out of bounds, we can either move left or right. Moving right brings us back to the previous position, so let's try moving left this time.

Next move: (0, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors)

The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "U-shape" or "horseshoe shape." The path starts at the top, goes down the left side, moves across the bottom, and then goes up the right side to reach the goal.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar U-shape, but with a different configuration:

```
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at the top left corner (P) at (0, 0).
- The goal (G) is at the bottom right corner (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form a U-shape path that allows the player to navigate from the start to the goal.
