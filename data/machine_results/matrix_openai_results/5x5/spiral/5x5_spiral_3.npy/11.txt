You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G) while avoiding walls. Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the current player position and the goal position.

The current player position (P) is at (0, 3).
The goal position (G) is at (2, 3).

We can move to any adjacent empty space (0) in the up, down, left, or right direction. Let's find the next move.

From (0, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 3) (blocked by a wall)
- Left: (0, 2) (empty space)
- Right: (0, 4) (empty space)

Let's move to the right to (0, 4).

The coordinates of the next move are (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 4) (blocked by a wall)
- Left: (0, 3) (empty space)
- Right: Not possible (out of bounds)

The only valid move is to the left to (0, 3).

The coordinates of the next move are (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems we have returned to the previous position. Let's re-evaluate the possible moves from (0, 3):

- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 3) (blocked by a wall)
- Left: (0, 2) (empty space)
- Right: (0, 4) (empty space, but we just came from there)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape

The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "U-shape" or "horseshoe shape." The path starts at the top, goes down the left side, moves across the bottom, and then goes up the right side to reach the goal.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar U-shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces:

```
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at the top left corner (0, 0).
- The goal is at the bottom right corner (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form a U-shape, similar to the original maze.
