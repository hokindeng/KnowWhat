You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G) while avoiding walls. Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the current player position and the goal position.

The current player position (P) is at (0, 3).
The goal position (G) is at (2, 3).

We can move to any adjacent empty space (0) in the up, down, left, or right direction. Let's find the next move.

From (0, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 3) - This is a wall (1)
- Left: (0, 2) - This is an empty space (0)
- Right: (0, 4) - This is an empty space (0)

Let's move to the right to (0, 4).

Next move: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (P) at (0, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 4) - This is a wall (1)
- Left: (0, 3) - This is an empty space (0)
- Right: Not possible (out of bounds)

The only valid move is to the left to (0, 3).

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems I made an error in my previous move. Let's correct that and find a valid path to the goal.

From the current player position (P) at (0, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves again:

- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 3) - This is a wall (1)
- Left: (0, 2) - This is an empty space (0)
- Right: (0, 4) - This is an empty space (0)

Since moving right to (0, 4) didn't help previously, let's try moving left to (0, 2).

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape

The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "U-shape" or "horseshoe shape." This shape starts from the top left, goes down the left side, across the bottom, and then up the right side, with a path leading to the goal in the middle.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar U-shape:

```
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at the top left corner (0, 0).
- The goal is at the bottom right corner (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form a U-shape, providing a valid path from the player to the goal.
