You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G) while avoiding walls. Let's start by identifying the current position of the player and the goal.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (1,0).
The goal position (G) is at coordinates (4,0).

We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player to the goal. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible moves level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path.

Let's start by exploring the possible moves from the current position (1,0):

1. Move up to (0,0)
2. Move down to (2,0)
3. Move left to (1,-1) (invalid move, out of bounds)
4. Move right to (1,1) (invalid move, wall)

From the valid moves, we can move to (0,0) or (2,0). Let's choose (2,0) as it brings us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to coordinates (2,0).

Please update the maze and provide the new state.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's continue solving the maze from the current player position (2,0).

From (2,0), the possible moves are:
1. Move up to (1,0)
2. Move down to (3,0)
3. Move left to (2,-1) (invalid move, out of bounds)
4. Move right to (2,1) (invalid move, wall)

From the valid moves, we can move to (1,0) or (3,0). Let's choose (3,0) as it brings us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to coordinates (3,0).

Please update the maze and provide the new state.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's continue solving the maze from the current player position (3,0).

From (3,0), the possible moves are:
1. Move up to (2,0)
2. Move down to (4,0)
3. Move left to (3,-1) (invalid move, out of bounds)
4. Move right to (3,1) (invalid move, wall)

From the valid moves, we can move to (2,0) or (4,0). Let's choose (4,0) as it brings us directly to the goal.

So, the next move is to coordinates (4,0).

Please update the maze and provide the new state.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" pattern.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag shape:

0 1 0 0 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 0 0 0 0

Explanation:
- The new maze is 5x5, the same size as the original.
- It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces.
- It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
- The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is a recognizable zigzag pattern.
