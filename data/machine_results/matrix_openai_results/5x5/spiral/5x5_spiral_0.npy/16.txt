You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the player and the goal.

The current player position (P) is at (4, 2).
The goal position (G) is at (3, 0).

We will use a step-by-step approach to find the path. Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (4, 2):

1. Move up to (3, 2)
2. Move down to (5, 2) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 1)
4. Move right to (4, 3)

From (4, 2), moving up to (3, 2) is not possible because it is a wall ('1'). Moving down is out of bounds. Moving left to (4, 1) and moving right to (4, 3) are both possible moves.

Let's choose to move right to (4, 3) as it seems to be a more direct path towards the goal.

So, the next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), let's consider the possible moves:

1. Move up to (3, 3)
2. Move down to (5, 3) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 2)
4. Move right to (4, 4)

From (4, 3), moving up to (3, 3) is not possible because it is a wall ('1'). Moving down is out of bounds. Moving left to (4, 2) is backtracking. Moving right to (4, 4) is a possible move.

Let's choose to move right to (4, 4).

So, the next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 4), let's consider the possible moves:

1. Move up to (3, 4)
2. Move down to (5, 4) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 3)
4. Move right to (4, 5) - not possible, out of bounds

From (4, 4), moving up to (3, 4) is not possible because it is a wall ('1'). Moving down and moving right are out of bounds. Moving left to (4, 3) is a possible move.

Let's choose to move left to (4, 3).

So, the next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), let's consider the possible moves again:

1. Move up to (3, 3)
2. Move down to (5, 3) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 2)
4. Move right to (4, 4)

Since moving up to (3, 3) is not possible because it is a wall ('1'), and moving down is out of bounds, and moving right to (4, 4) is backtracking, the only viable move is to move left to (4, 2).

However, we have already tried moving left to (4, 2) and it didn't lead us closer to the goal. Let's re-evaluate our strategy. We need to find a path that gets us closer to the goal at (3, 0).

From (4, 3), let's consider moving up to (3, 3) again. Although it is a wall, we need to find a way around it. Let's backtrack to (4, 2) and explore other options from there.

So, the next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 2), let's consider the possible moves:

1. Move up to (3, 2)
2. Move down to (5, 2) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 1)
4. Move right to (4, 3)

From (4, 2), moving up to (3, 2) is not possible because it is a wall ('1'). Moving down is out of bounds. Moving left to (4, 1) and moving right to (4, 3) are both possible moves.

Since moving right to (4, 3) leads us back to where we were, let's try moving left to (4, 1).

So, the next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

1. Move up to (3, 1)
2. Move down to (5, 1) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 0)
4. Move right to (4, 2)

From (4, 1), moving up to (3, 1) is not possible because it is a wall ('1'). Moving down is out of bounds. Moving right to (4, 2) is backtracking. Moving left to (4, 0) is a possible move.

Let's choose to move left to (4, 0).

So, the next move is to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0

G 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 0), let's consider the possible moves:

1. Move up to (3, 0)
2. Move down to (5, 0) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, -1) - not possible, out of bounds
4. Move right to (4, 1)

From (4, 0), moving up to (3, 0) is a possible move and it brings us closer to the goal (G).

Let's choose to move up to (3, 0).

So, the next move is to (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape

The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "U-shape".

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form a U-shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and it is not an identical copy of the original maze.

```
P 0 1 1 0
0 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at the top left corner (0, 0).
- The goal is at the bottom right corner (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form a U-shape, similar to the original maze.
