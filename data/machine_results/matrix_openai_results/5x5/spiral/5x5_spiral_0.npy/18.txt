You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). The current player position is at coordinates (4, 2), and the goal position is at coordinates (3, 0).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (4, 2):

1. Move up to (3, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
2. Move down to (5, 2) - This is outside the maze boundaries, so it's not a valid move.
3. Move left to (4, 1) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
4. Move right to (4, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.

Given that both left and right are valid moves, let's choose to move left first to explore that path.

The next move is to coordinates (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 1), let's analyze the possible moves:

1. Move up to (3, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
2. Move down to (5, 1) - This is outside the maze boundaries, so it's not a valid move.
3. Move left to (4, 0) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
4. Move right to (4, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), but it is the position we just came from.

Given that moving left to (4, 0) is a valid move and it takes us closer to the goal, let's choose that move.

The next move is to coordinates (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 0), let's analyze the possible moves:

1. Move up to (3, 0) - This is the goal position ('G'), so it's a valid move and the optimal choice.
2. Move down to (5, 0) - This is outside the maze boundaries, so it's not a valid move.
3. Move left to (4, -1) - This is outside the maze boundaries, so it's not a valid move.
4. Move right to (4, 1) - This is an empty space ('0'), but it is the position we just came from.

Given that moving up to (3, 0) reaches the goal, let's choose that move.

The next move is to coordinates (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a "U" shape:

```
P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at the top left corner (0, 0).
- The goal is at the bottom right corner (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form a "U" shape, similar to the original maze.
