You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the current position of the player and the goal:

Current player position (P): (4, 1)
Goal position (G): (3, 4)

We will use a step-by-step approach to find the path. Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (4, 1):

1. Move up to (3, 1)
2. Move down to (5, 1) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 0)
4. Move right to (4, 2)

From the current position (4, 1), moving up to (3, 1) or left to (4, 0) will lead to walls. Moving right to (4, 2) is an empty space and a valid move.

So, the next move is to (4, 2).

Please update the maze and provide the new configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (4, 2):

1. Move up to (3, 2)
2. Move down to (5, 2) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 1) - already visited
4. Move right to (4, 3)

From the current position (4, 2), moving up to (3, 2) or right to (4, 3) are valid moves. Moving up to (3, 2) seems to be a better choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (3, 2).

Please update the maze and provide the new configuration.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" pattern.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" shape:

```
1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 G
P 0 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at position (4, 0) and the goal is at position (3, 4).
- The empty spaces form a zigzag pattern similar to the original maze.
- The maze is not an identical copy of the original but maintains the recognizable zigzag shape.
