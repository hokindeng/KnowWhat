You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). The current player position is at (4, 1) and the goal position is at (3, 4). Let's find the next move.

Here is the current maze with coordinates for reference:

```
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4)
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4)
(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4)
(3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4)
(4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4)
```

```
0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0
```

The player is currently at (4, 1). The possible moves from this position are:
- Up to (3, 1) - but this is a wall.
- Down to (5, 1) - but this is out of bounds.
- Left to (4, 0) - which is an empty space.
- Right to (4, 2) - which is an empty space.

To move towards the goal, the best move is to the right to (4, 2).

So, the next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current player position is now at (4, 2). The goal position remains at (3, 4). Let's find the next move.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors)

The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze can be described as a "zigzag" or "serpentine" path. The path winds back and forth, creating a series of turns that navigate around the walls.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag or serpentine path. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces.

```
1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
P 0 0 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at (4, 0) and the goal is at (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form a zigzag path that navigates around the walls, similar to the original maze.
