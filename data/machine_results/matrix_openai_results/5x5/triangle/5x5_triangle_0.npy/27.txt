You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 0 P 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). The current player position is at (4, 3) and the goal position is at (3, 1).

Let's evaluate the possible moves from the current position (4, 3):

1. Up: (3, 3) - This is an empty space ('0').
2. Down: (5, 3) - This is out of bounds.
3. Left: (4, 2) - This is an empty space ('0').
4. Right: (4, 4) - This is a wall ('1').
5. Up-Left: (3, 2) - This is a wall ('1').
6. Up-Right: (3, 4) - This is a wall ('1').
7. Down-Left: (5, 2) - This is out of bounds.
8. Down-Right: (5, 4) - This is out of bounds.

The valid moves are:
- Up to (3, 3)
- Left to (4, 2)

Let's choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Moving up to (3, 3) seems like a good choice because it brings us closer to the goal position (3, 1).

So, the next move is to go up to (3, 3).

Please update the maze and provide the new configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 P 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's evaluate the possible moves from the current position (3, 3):

1. Up: (2, 3) - This is an empty space ('0').
2. Down: (4, 3) - This is an empty space ('0').
3. Left: (3, 2) - This is a wall ('1').
4. Right: (3, 4) - This is a wall ('1').
5. Up-Left: (2, 2) - This is an empty space ('0').
6. Up-Right: (2, 4) - This is a wall ('1').
7. Down-Left: (4, 2) - This is an empty space ('0').
8. Down-Right: (4, 4) - This is a wall ('1').

The valid moves are:
- Up to (2, 3)
- Down to (4, 3)
- Up-Left to (2, 2)
- Down-Left to (4, 2)

Let's choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Moving up to (2, 3) seems like a good choice because it brings us closer to the goal position (3, 1).

So, the next move is to go up to (2, 3).

- Down-Right to (3, 3)

Let's choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Moving down-right to (3, 1) will take us directly to the goal position.

So, the next move is to go down-left to (3, 1).

Please update the maze and provide the new configuration.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern:

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
P 0 0 G 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at position (4, 0) marked by 'P'.
- The goal is at position (4, 3) marked by 'G'.
- The empty spaces form a zigzag pattern similar to the original maze.
