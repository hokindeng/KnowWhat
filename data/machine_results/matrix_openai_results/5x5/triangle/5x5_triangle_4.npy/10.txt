You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the player and the goal.

The maze is:
```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

From the maze, we can see:
- The player (P) is at coordinates (2, 1).
- The goal (G) is at coordinates (0, 2).

We can move to any adjacent empty space (0). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (2, 1):

1. Up: (1, 1)
2. Down: (3, 1)
3. Left: (2, 0) - This is a wall.
4. Right: (2, 2)
5. Diagonal Up-Left: (1, 0) - This is a wall.
6. Diagonal Up-Right: (1, 2) - This is a wall.
7. Diagonal Down-Left: (3, 0) - This is a wall.
8. Diagonal Down-Right: (3, 2) - This is a wall.

The valid moves are:
- Up: (1, 1)
- Down: (3, 1)
- Right: (2, 2)

Let's choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Moving right to (2, 2) seems like a good option because it brings us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to coordinates (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the current state of the maze and determine the next move:

```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (2, 2), and the goal (G) is still at coordinates (0, 2).

From the current position (2, 2), the possible moves are:

1. Up: (1, 2) - This is a wall.
2. Down: (3, 2) - This is a wall.
3. Left: (2, 1)
4. Right: (2, 3) - This is a wall.
5. Diagonal Up-Left: (1, 1)
6. Diagonal Up-Right: (1, 3)
7. Diagonal Down-Left: (3, 1)
8. Diagonal Down-Right: (3, 3) - This is a wall.

The valid moves are:
- Left: (2, 1)
- Diagonal Up-Left: (1, 1)
- Diagonal Up-Right: (1, 3)
- Diagonal Down-Left: (3, 1)

Let's choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Moving diagonally up-right to (1, 3) seems like a good option because it brings us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to coordinates (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 P 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the current state of the maze and determine the next move:

```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 P 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (1, 3), and the goal (G) is still at coordinates (0, 2).

From the current position (1, 3), the possible moves are:

1. Up: (0, 3)
2. Down: (2, 3) - This is a wall.
3. Left: (1, 2) - This is a wall.
4. Right: (1, 4) - This is a wall.
5. Diagonal Up-Left: (0, 2)
6. Diagonal Up-Right: (0, 4)
7. Diagonal Down-Left: (2, 2)
8. Diagonal Down-Right: (2, 4) - This is a wall.

The valid moves are:
- Up: (0, 3)
- Diagonal Up-Left: (0, 2)
- Diagonal Down-Left: (2, 2)

Let's choose the move that brings us directly to the goal. Moving diagonally up-left to (0, 2) will take us directly to the goal.

So, the next move is to coordinates (0, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze. The original maze is:

```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

The empty spaces form a shape that resembles a "Z" or a zigzag pattern.

### (1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a "Z" shape.

### (2) A new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "Z" shape:

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

```
1 1 1 0 0
1 1 0 1 1
P 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
G 0 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player (P) starts at coordinates (2, 0).
- The goal (G) is at coordinates (4, 0).
- The empty spaces form a "Z" shape, similar to the original maze.

This new maze maintains the same general shape of the corridors while providing a valid path from the player to the goal.
