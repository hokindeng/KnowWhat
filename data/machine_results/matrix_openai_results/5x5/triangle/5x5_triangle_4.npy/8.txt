You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the player and the goal.

The maze is:
```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

From this, we can see:
- The player (P) is at coordinates (2, 1).
- The goal (G) is at coordinates (0, 2).

We can move to any adjacent empty space (0). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (2, 1):

1. Up: (1, 1)
2. Down: (3, 1)
3. Left: (2, 0) - but this is a wall (1)
4. Right: (2, 2)
5. Diagonal moves:
   - Up-Left: (1, 0) - but this is a wall (1)
   - Up-Right: (1, 2) - but this is a wall (1)
   - Down-Left: (3, 0) - but this is a wall (1)
   - Down-Right: (3, 2) - but this is a wall (1)

The valid moves are:
- Up: (1, 1)
- Down: (3, 1)
- Right: (2, 2)

To get closer to the goal, moving right to (2, 2) seems like a good option.

So, the next move is to coordinates (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The updated maze is:
```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (2, 2). The goal (G) is still at coordinates (0, 2).

From the current position (2, 2), let's consider the possible moves:

1. Up: (1, 2) - but this is a wall (1)
2. Down: (3, 2) - but this is a wall (1)
3. Left: (2, 1) - this is an empty space (0)
4. Right: (2, 3) - but this is a wall (1)
5. Diagonal moves:
   - Up-Left: (1, 1) - this is an empty space (0)
   - Up-Right: (1, 3) - this is an empty space (0)
   - Down-Left: (3, 1) - this is an empty space (0)
   - Down-Right: (3, 3) - but this is a wall (1)

The valid moves are:
- Left: (2, 1)
- Up-Left: (1, 1)
- Up-Right: (1, 3)
- Down-Left: (3, 1)

To get closer to the goal, moving up-right to (1, 3) seems like a good option.

So, the next move is to coordinates (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 P 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The updated maze is:
```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 P 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (1, 3). The goal (G) is still at coordinates (0, 2).

From the current position (1, 3), let's consider the possible moves:

1. Up: (0, 3) - this is an empty space (0)
2. Down: (2, 3) - but this is a wall (1)
3. Left: (1, 2) - but this is a wall (1)
4. Right: (1, 4) - but this is a wall (1)
5. Diagonal moves:
   - Up-Left: (0, 2) - this is the goal (G)
   - Up-Right: (0, 4) - this is an empty space (0)
   - Down-Left: (2, 2) - this is an empty space (0)
   - Down-Right: (2, 4) - but this is a wall (1)

The valid moves are:
- Up: (0, 3)
- Up-Left: (0, 2) - this is the goal (G)
- Up-Right: (0, 4)
- Down-Left: (2, 2)

To reach the goal, moving up-left to (0, 2) is the best option.

So, the next move is to coordinates (0, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Let's analyze the original maze to determine the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors):

Original maze:
```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

The empty spaces form a shape that resembles a "Z" or zigzag pattern. 

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a "Z" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "Z" shape:

```
1 1 1 0 0
1 1 0 0 1
P 0 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player (P) starts at (2, 0).
- The goal (G) is at (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form a "Z" shape, providing a valid path from P to G.
