You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). The current player position is at (2, 1) and the goal position is at (0, 2). Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position:

From (2, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up to (1, 1)
- Down to (3, 1)
- Left to (2, 0) (blocked by a wall)
- Right to (2, 2)
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-left to (1, 0) (blocked by a wall)
  - Up-right to (1, 2) (blocked by a wall)
  - Down-left to (3, 0) (blocked by a wall)
  - Down-right to (3, 2) (blocked by a wall)

Among these, the valid moves are:
- Up to (1, 1)
- Down to (3, 1)
- Right to (2, 2)

Let's choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Moving right to (2, 2) seems like a good option because it brings us closer to the goal at (0, 2).

So, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), let's analyze the possible moves:

From (2, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up to (1, 2) (blocked by a wall)
- Down to (3, 2) (blocked by a wall)
- Left to (2, 1)
- Right to (2, 3) (blocked by a wall)
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-left to (1, 1)
  - Up-right to (1, 3)
  - Down-left to (3, 1)
  - Down-right to (3, 3) (blocked by a wall)

Among these, the valid moves are:
- Left to (2, 1)
- Up-left to (1, 1)
- Up-right to (1, 3)
- Down-left to (3, 1)

Let's choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Moving up-left to (1, 1) seems like a good option because it brings us closer to the goal at (0, 2).

So, the next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 1), let's analyze the possible moves:

From (1, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up to (0, 1)
- Down to (2, 1)
- Left to (1, 0) (blocked by a wall)
- Right to (1, 2) (blocked by a wall)
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-left to (0, 0) (blocked by a wall)
  - Up-right to (0, 2)
  - Down-left to (2, 0) (blocked by a wall)
  - Down-right to (2, 2)

Among these, the valid moves are:
- Up to (0, 1)
- Down to (2, 1)
- Up-right to (0, 2)
- Down-right to (2, 2)

Let's choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Moving up-right to (0, 2) seems like the best option because it directly reaches the goal.

So, the next move is to (0, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" pattern.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" shape:

```
1 0 0 0 G
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
P 0 0 0 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at the bottom left corner (4, 0).
- The goal is at the top right corner (0, 4).
- The empty spaces form a zigzag pattern similar to the original maze.
