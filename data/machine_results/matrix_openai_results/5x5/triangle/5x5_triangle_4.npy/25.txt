You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the player and the goal:

- Player position (P): (2, 1)
- Goal position (G): (0, 2)

We can move to any adjacent empty space (0) in the maze. Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (2, 1):

1. Up: (1, 1)
2. Down: (3, 1)
3. Left: (2, 0) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
4. Right: (2, 2)
5. Diagonal Up-Left: (1, 0) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
6. Diagonal Up-Right: (1, 2)
7. Diagonal Down-Left: (3, 0) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
8. Diagonal Down-Right: (3, 2) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.

From the valid moves, let's choose the one that brings us closer to the goal. Moving to (2, 2) seems like a good option because it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's identify the current position of the player and the goal again:

- Player position (P): (2, 2)
- Goal position (G): (0, 2)

From the current position (2, 2), let's consider the possible moves:

1. Up: (1, 2) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
2. Down: (3, 2) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
3. Left: (2, 1) - This is an empty space (0), and we have already been here.
4. Right: (2, 3) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
5. Diagonal Up-Left: (1, 1) - This is an empty space (0).
6. Diagonal Up-Right: (1, 3) - This is an empty space (0).
7. Diagonal Down-Left: (3, 1) - This is an empty space (0).
8. Diagonal Down-Right: (3, 3) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.

From the valid moves, moving to (1, 1) or (1, 3) seems like a good option. Let's choose (1, 1) because it brings us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's identify the current position of the player and the goal again:

- Player position (P): (1, 1)
- Goal position (G): (0, 2)

From the current position (1, 1), let's consider the possible moves:

1. Up: (0, 1) - This is an empty space (0).
2. Down: (2, 1) - This is an empty space (0), and we have already been here.
3. Left: (1, 0) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
4. Right: (1, 2) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
5. Diagonal Up-Left: (0, 0) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
6. Diagonal Up-Right: (0, 2) - This is the goal (G).
7. Diagonal Down-Left: (2, 0) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
8. Diagonal Down-Right: (2, 2) - This is an empty space (0), and we have already been here.

From the valid moves, moving to (0, 2) is the best option because it is the goal.

So, the next move is to (0, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors)

The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The path moves diagonally and then straight, creating a zigzag-like shape.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces forming a similar zigzag pattern. The maze includes a valid path from P to G:

```
1 1 1 1 1
P 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 G 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at (1, 0) and the goal is at (4, 3).
- The empty spaces form a zigzag pattern similar to the original maze.
- The path from P to G is valid and can be reached through empty spaces.
