You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the player and the goal.

The maze is:
```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

From the maze, we can see:
- The player (P) is at coordinates (2, 1).
- The goal (G) is at coordinates (0, 2).

We need to find a path from (2, 1) to (0, 2). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (2, 1):

1. Up: (1, 1)
2. Down: (3, 1)
3. Left: (2, 0)
4. Right: (2, 2)
5. Diagonal Up-Left: (1, 0)
6. Diagonal Up-Right: (1, 2)
7. Diagonal Down-Left: (3, 0)
8. Diagonal Down-Right: (3, 2)

We need to avoid walls ('1') and move only to empty spaces ('0') or the goal ('G').

From (2, 1), the valid moves are:
- Up: (1, 1) (empty space)
- Right: (2, 2) (empty space)

Let's choose to move right to (2, 2) as it brings us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to coordinates (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The updated maze is:
```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (2, 2). The goal (G) is still at coordinates (0, 2).

From (2, 2), the possible moves are:
1. Up: (1, 2) (wall)
2. Down: (3, 2) (wall)
3. Left: (2, 1) (empty space)
4. Right: (2, 3) (wall)
5. Diagonal Up-Left: (1, 1) (empty space)
6. Diagonal Up-Right: (1, 3) (empty space)
7. Diagonal Down-Left: (3, 1) (empty space)
8. Diagonal Down-Right: (3, 3) (wall)

The valid moves are:
- Left: (2, 1) (empty space)
- Diagonal Up-Left: (1, 1) (empty space)
- Diagonal Up-Right: (1, 3) (empty space)
- Diagonal Down-Left: (3, 1) (empty space)

To get closer to the goal, let's move diagonally up-right to (1, 3).

So, the next move is to coordinates (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 P 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The updated maze is:
```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 P 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (1, 3). The goal (G) is still at coordinates (0, 2).

From (1, 3), the possible moves are:
1. Up: (0, 3) (empty space)
2. Down: (2, 3) (wall)
3. Left: (1, 2) (wall)
4. Right: (1, 4) (wall)
5. Diagonal Up-Left: (0, 2) (goal)
6. Diagonal Up-Right: (0, 4) (empty space)
7. Diagonal Down-Left: (2, 2) (empty space)
8. Diagonal Down-Right: (2, 4) (wall)

The valid moves are:
- Up: (0, 3) (empty space)
- Diagonal Up-Left: (0, 2) (goal)
- Diagonal Up-Right: (0, 4) (empty space)
- Diagonal Down-Left: (2, 2) (empty space)

To reach the goal, let's move diagonally up-left to (0, 2).

So, the next move is to coordinates (0, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors)

The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze can be described as a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern allows movement in a stepwise manner, either horizontally or vertically, with occasional diagonal moves.

### (2) A New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The maze includes a valid path from P to G:

```
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 G
P 0 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player (P) starts at coordinates (4, 0).
- The goal (G) is at coordinates (3, 4).

The empty spaces form a zigzag pattern that allows the player to navigate from the starting position to the goal.
