You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the current player position and the goal position.

The current player position (P) is at (4, 4).
The goal position (G) is at (2, 3).

We need to find a path from (4, 4) to (2, 3). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position:

From (4, 4), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 4)
- Left to (4, 3)
- Diagonal up-left to (3, 3)

Let's evaluate these moves:
- Moving up to (3, 4) is an empty space (0).
- Moving left to (4, 3) is an empty space (0).
- Moving diagonal up-left to (3, 3) is a wall (1).

Since moving diagonal up-left to (3, 3) is not possible, we will consider the other two moves.

Let's move left to (4, 3).

The coordinates of the next move are (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 3) is a wall (1).
- Down to (5, 3) is out of bounds.
- Left to (4, 2) is an empty space (0).
- Right to (4, 4) is an empty space (0).
- Diagonal up-left to (3, 2) is an empty space (0).
- Diagonal up-right to (3, 4) is a wall (1).
- Diagonal down-left to (5, 2) is out of bounds.
- Diagonal down-right to (5, 4) is out of bounds.

Since moving up, down, diagonal up-right, diagonal down-left, and diagonal down-right are not possible, we will consider the other moves.

Let's move left to (4, 2).

The coordinates of the next move are (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 2) is an empty space (0).
- Down to (5, 2) is out of bounds.
- Left to (4, 1) is an empty space (0).
- Right to (4, 3) is an empty space (0).
- Diagonal up-left to (3, 1) is a wall (1).
- Diagonal up-right to (3, 3) is a wall (1).
- Diagonal down-left to (5, 1) is out of bounds.
- Diagonal down-right to (5, 3) is out of bounds.

Since moving down, diagonal up-left, diagonal up-right, diagonal down-left, and diagonal down-right are not possible, we will consider the other moves.

Let's move up to (3, 2).

The coordinates of the next move are (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 P 1 0
1 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (2, 2) is a wall (1).
- Down to (4, 2) is an empty space (0).
- Left to (3, 1) is a wall (1).
- Right to (3, 3) is a wall (1).
- Diagonal up-left to (2, 1) is a wall (1).
- Diagonal up-right to (2, 3) is the goal (G).
- Diagonal down-left to (4, 1) is an empty space (0).
- Diagonal down-right to (4, 3) is an empty space (0).

Since moving up, left, right, diagonal up-left, and diagonal down-left are not possible, we will consider the other moves.

Let's move diagonal up-right to (2, 3), which is the goal (G).

The coordinates of the next move are (2, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form an "L" shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces:

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
P 0 0 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at the bottom left corner (4, 0).
- The goal is at the bottom right corner (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze.
