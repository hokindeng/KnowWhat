You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the current player position and the goal position.

The current player position (P) is at (4, 4).
The goal position (G) is at (2, 3).

We need to find a path from (4, 4) to (2, 3). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position:

1. Up: (3, 4)
2. Down: Not possible (out of bounds)
3. Left: (4, 3)
4. Right: Not possible (out of bounds)
5. Diagonal up-left: (3, 3)
6. Diagonal up-right: (3, 5) (out of bounds)
7. Diagonal down-left: Not possible (out of bounds)
8. Diagonal down-right: Not possible (out of bounds)

From (4, 4), the valid moves are:
- (3, 4): This is a wall.
- (4, 3): This is an empty space.
- (3, 3): This is a wall.

The only valid move is to (4, 3).

So, the next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's identify the current player position and the goal position again:

The current player position (P) is now at (4, 3).
The goal position (G) is at (2, 3).

We need to find a path from (4, 3) to (2, 3). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position:

1. Up: (3, 3)
2. Down: Not possible (out of bounds)
3. Left: (4, 2)
4. Right: (4, 4)
5. Diagonal up-left: (3, 2)
6. Diagonal up-right: (3, 4)
7. Diagonal down-left: Not possible (out of bounds)
8. Diagonal down-right: Not possible (out of bounds)

From (4, 3), the valid moves are:
- (3, 3): This is a wall.
- (4, 2): This is an empty space.
- (4, 4): This is an empty space.
- (3, 2): This is an empty space.
- (3, 4): This is a wall.

The best move to get closer to the goal is to (3, 2).

So, the next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 P 1 0
1 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's identify the current player position and the goal position again:

The current player position (P) is now at (3, 2).
The goal position (G) is at (2, 3).

We need to find a path from (3, 2) to (2, 3). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position:

1. Up: (2, 2)
2. Down: (4, 2)
3. Left: (3, 1)
4. Right: (3, 3)
5. Diagonal up-left: (2, 1)
6. Diagonal up-right: (2, 3)
7. Diagonal down-left: (4, 1)
8. Diagonal down-right: (4, 3)

From (3, 2), the valid moves are:
- (2, 2): This is a wall.
- (4, 2): This is an empty space.
- (3, 1): This is a wall.
- (3, 3): This is a wall.
- (2, 1): This is a wall.
- (2, 3): This is the goal position.
- (4, 1): This is an empty space.
- (4, 3): This is an empty space.

The best move to get closer to the goal is to (2, 3).

So, the next move is to (2, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape Formed by the Empty Spaces

The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze can be described as a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The empty spaces create a path that moves diagonally up and down, resembling a zigzag or staircase.

### (2) A New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar zigzag or staircase pattern. The maze includes a valid path from P to G:

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G
1 1 0 0 0
1 P 0 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at (4, 1) (P).
- The goal is at (2, 4) (G).
- The empty spaces form a zigzag or staircase pattern, similar to the original maze.
