You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the player and the goal:

- Player position (P): (4, 4)
- Goal position (G): (2, 2)

We need to find a path from (4, 4) to (2, 2). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (4, 4):

1. Up: (3, 4)
2. Down: Not possible (out of bounds)
3. Left: (4, 3)
4. Right: Not possible (out of bounds)
5. Diagonal up-left: (3, 3)
6. Diagonal up-right: (3, 5) (out of bounds)
7. Diagonal down-left: Not possible (out of bounds)
8. Diagonal down-right: Not possible (out of bounds)

From the current position (4, 4), the valid moves are:
- Up to (3, 4)
- Left to (4, 3)
- Diagonal up-left to (3, 3)

Let's choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Moving diagonally up-left to (3, 3) seems like a good choice because it brings us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's evaluate the current position and possible moves again. The current player position (P) is now at (3, 3), and the goal position (G) remains at (2, 2).

From the current position (3, 3), the possible moves are:

1. Up: (2, 3)
2. Down: (4, 3)
3. Left: (3, 2)
4. Right: (3, 4)
5. Diagonal up-left: (2, 2)
6. Diagonal up-right: (2, 4)
7. Diagonal down-left: (4, 2)
8. Diagonal down-right: (4, 4)

Let's check the validity of these moves:
- Up to (2, 3): This is a wall (1).
- Down to (4, 3): This is an empty space (0).
- Left to (3, 2): This is an empty space (0).
- Right to (3, 4): This is an empty space (0).
- Diagonal up-left to (2, 2): This is the goal (G).
- Diagonal up-right to (2, 4): This is a wall (1).
- Diagonal down-left to (4, 2): This is a wall (1).
- Diagonal down-right to (4, 4): This is the previous position (4, 4).

The best move is to go directly to the goal position (2, 2).

So, the next move is to (2, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors)

The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "Z" shape. The path starts from the bottom right, moves left, then up, and finally to the left again to reach the goal.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 G 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
P 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at the bottom left (P) at position (4, 0).
- The goal (G) is at position (2, 2).
- The empty spaces form a "Z" shape, providing a valid path from the player to the goal.
