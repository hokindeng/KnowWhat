You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). The current player position is at (4, 4) and the goal position is at (2, 3). Let's find the next move.

From (4, 4), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 4) - but it's a wall.
- Down to (5, 4) - but it's outside the maze.
- Left to (4, 3) - which is an empty space.
- Right to (4, 5) - but it's outside the maze.
- Diagonally up-left to (3, 3) - but it's a wall.
- Diagonally up-right to (3, 5) - but it's outside the maze.
- Diagonally down-left to (5, 3) - but it's outside the maze.
- Diagonally down-right to (5, 5) - but it's outside the maze.

The only valid move is to the left to (4, 3).

So, the next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 3) - but it's a wall.
- Down to (5, 3) - but it's outside the maze.
- Left to (4, 2) - which is an empty space.
- Right to (4, 4) - which is an empty space.
- Diagonally up-left to (3, 2) - but it's a wall.
- Diagonally up-right to (3, 4) - but it's a wall.
- Diagonally down-left to (5, 2) - but it's outside the maze.
- Diagonally down-right to (5, 4) - but it's outside the maze.

The valid moves are to the left to (4, 2) or to the right to (4, 4). Moving left to (4, 2) brings us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 2) - but it's a wall.
- Down to (5, 2) - but it's outside the maze.
- Left to (4, 1) - which is an empty space.
- Right to (4, 3) - which is an empty space.
- Diagonally up-left to (3, 1) - but it's a wall.
- Diagonally up-right to (3, 3) - but it's a wall.
- Diagonally down-left to (5, 1) - but it's outside the maze.
- Diagonally down-right to (5, 3) - but it's outside the maze.

The valid moves are to the left to (4, 1) or to the right to (4, 3). Moving left to (4, 1) brings us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (4, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "L" shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 G

In this new maze:
- The player starts at the bottom left corner (4, 0).
- The goal is at the bottom right corner (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze.
