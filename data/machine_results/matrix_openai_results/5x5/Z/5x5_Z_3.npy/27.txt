You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). The current player position is at (4, 4) and the goal position is at (2, 3). Let's find the next move.

From (4, 4), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 4) - but this is a wall.
- Down to (5, 4) - but this is out of bounds.
- Left to (4, 3) - this is an empty space.
- Right to (4, 5) - but this is out of bounds.
- Diagonally up-left to (3, 3) - but this is a wall.
- Diagonally up-right to (3, 5) - but this is out of bounds.
- Diagonally down-left to (5, 3) - but this is out of bounds.
- Diagonally down-right to (5, 5) - but this is out of bounds.

The only valid move is to the left to (4, 3).

So, the next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 3) - but this is a wall.
- Down to (5, 3) - but this is out of bounds.
- Left to (4, 2) - this is an empty space.
- Right to (4, 4) - this is an empty space.
- Diagonally up-left to (3, 2) - but this is a wall.
- Diagonally up-right to (3, 4) - but this is a wall.
- Diagonally down-left to (5, 2) - but this is out of bounds.
- Diagonally down-right to (5, 4) - but this is out of bounds.

The valid moves are to the left to (4, 2) or to the right to (4, 4). Moving left to (4, 2) seems to bring us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 2), the possible moves are:

- Diagonally down-left to (5, 1) - but this is out of bounds.
- Diagonally down-right to (5, 3) - but this is out of bounds.

The valid moves are to the left to (4, 1) or to the right to (4, 3). Moving left to (4, 1) seems to bring us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (4, 1).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems we have returned to the previous position (4, 2). Let's re-evaluate the possible moves from this position:

From (4, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 2) - but this is a wall.
- Down to (5, 2) - but this is out of bounds.

- Diagonally down-left to (5, 1) - but this is out of bounds.
- Diagonally down-right to (5, 3) - but this is out of bounds.

Since moving left to (4, 1) brings us back to the previous position, let's try moving right to (4, 3) again.

So, the next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1

From the current position (4, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 3) - but this is a wall.
- Down to (5, 3) - but this is out of bounds.
- Left to (4, 2) - this is an empty space.

- Diagonally down-left to (5, 2) - but this is out of bounds.
- Diagonally down-right to (5, 4) - but this is out of bounds.

Since moving left to (4, 2) and right to (4, 4) brings us back to previous positions, let's try moving up from (4, 2) to (3, 2).

So, the next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 0 0 0

- Down to (4, 2) - this is an empty space.
- Left to (3, 1) - but this is a wall.
- Right to (3, 3) - but this is a wall.
- Diagonally up-left to (2, 1) - but this is a wall.
- Diagonally up-right to (2, 3) - this is the goal position (G).
- Diagonally down-left to (4, 1) - this is an empty space.
- Diagonally down-right to (4, 3) - this is an empty space.

The valid move that brings us closer to the goal is diagonally up-right to (2, 3).

So, the next move is to (2, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern:

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
P 0 0 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at the bottom left corner (4, 0).
- The goal is at the bottom right corner (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form a zigzag pattern that allows a valid path from P to G.
