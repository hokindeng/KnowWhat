You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's first identify the coordinates of the current player position and the goal position.

The maze is:
```
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
```

From the maze, we can see:
- The current player position (P) is at coordinates (3, 2).
- The goal position (G) is at coordinates (3, 0).

We can move to any adjacent empty space (0) in the up, down, left, or right direction. Let's determine the next move.

From (3, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up to (2, 2) which is an empty space (0).
- Down to (4, 2) which is an empty space (0).
- Left to (3, 1) which is a wall (1).
- Right to (3, 3) which is a wall (1).

The best move to get closer to the goal (3, 0) is to move left to (3, 1), but since it's a wall, we should consider moving up or down.

Let's move up to (2, 2).

So, the next move is to coordinates (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the current state of the maze:

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
```

The current player position (P) is now at coordinates (2, 2).

From (2, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up to (1, 2) which is a wall (1).
- Down to (3, 2) which is an empty space (0).
- Left to (2, 1) which is an empty space (0).
- Right to (2, 3) which is a wall (1).

To get closer to the goal (3, 0), the best move is to move down to (3, 2).

So, the next move is to coordinates (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1

```

The current player position (P) is now at coordinates (3, 2).

From (3, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up to (2, 2) which is an empty space (0).
- Down to (4, 2) which is an empty space (0).
- Left to (3, 1) which is a wall (1).
- Right to (3, 3) which is a wall (1).

To get closer to the goal (3, 0), the best move is to move left to (3, 1), but since it's a wall, we should consider moving down.

Let's move down to (4, 2).

So, the next move is to coordinates (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

```

The current player position (P) is now at coordinates (4, 2).

From (4, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 2) which is an empty space (0).
- Down to (5, 2) which is out of bounds.
- Left to (4, 1) which is an empty space (0).
- Right to (4, 3) which is a wall (1).

To get closer to the goal (3, 0), the best move is to move left to (4, 1).

So, the next move is to coordinates (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

The current player position (P) is now at coordinates (4, 1).

From (4, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 1) which is a wall (1).
- Down to (5, 1) which is out of bounds.
- Left to (4, 0) which is an empty space (0).
- Right to (4, 2) which is an empty space (0).

To get closer to the goal (3, 0), the best move is to move left to (4, 0).

So, the next move is to coordinates (4, 0).

The current player position (P) is now at coordinates (4, 0).

From (4, 0), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 0) which is the goal (G).
- Down to (5, 0) which is out of bounds.
- Left to (4, -1) which is out of bounds.
- Right to (4, 1) which is an empty space (0).

To reach the goal (3, 0), the best move is to move up to (3, 0).

So, the next move is to coordinates (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Z" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "Z" shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at the top left corner (0, 1).
- The goal is at the bottom right corner (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form a "Z" shape, similar to the original maze.
