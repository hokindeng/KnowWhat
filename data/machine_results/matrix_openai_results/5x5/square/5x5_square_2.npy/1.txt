You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the player and the goal.

The maze is:
```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
```

From the maze, we can see:
- The player (P) is at coordinates (3, 2).
- The goal (G) is at coordinates (0, 2).

We need to find a path from (3, 2) to (0, 2). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (3, 2):

1. Up: (2, 2) - This is a wall.
2. Down: (4, 2) - This is a wall.
3. Left: (3, 1) - This is an empty space.
4. Right: (3, 3) - This is an empty space.

Since moving left or right are the only valid moves, let's choose to move left first to explore that path.

The next move is to (3, 1).

Please update the maze and provide the new configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The updated maze is:
```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (3, 1). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (3, 1):

1. Up: (2, 1) - This is an empty space.
2. Down: (4, 1) - This is a wall.
3. Left: (3, 0) - This is a wall.
4. Right: (3, 2) - This is an empty space (previous position).

Since moving up is a valid move and brings us closer to the goal, let's move up.

The next move is to (2, 1).

Please update the maze and provide the new configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The updated maze is:
```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (2, 1). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (2, 1):

1. Up: (1, 1) - This is an empty space.
2. Down: (3, 1) - This is an empty space (previous position).
3. Left: (2, 0) - This is a wall.
4. Right: (2, 2) - This is a wall.

Since moving up is a valid move and brings us closer to the goal, let's move up.

The next move is to (1, 1).

Please update the maze and provide the new configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The updated maze is:
```
1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (1, 1). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (1, 1):

1. Up: (0, 1) - This is an empty space.
2. Down: (2, 1) - This is an empty space (previous position).
3. Left: (1, 0) - This is a wall.
4. Right: (1, 2) - This is a wall.

Since moving up is a valid move and brings us closer to the goal, let's move up.

The next move is to (0, 1).

Please update the maze and provide the new configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 P G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The updated maze is:
```
1 P G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (0, 1). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (0, 1):

1. Up: Not possible (out of bounds).
2. Down: (1, 1) - This is an empty space (previous position).
3. Left: (0, 0) - This is a wall.
4. Right: (0, 2) - This is the goal (G).

Since moving right will take us to the goal, let's move right.

The next move is to (0, 2).

Congratulations! You have reached the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a "U" shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces and is not an identical copy of the original maze:

```
1 1 1 0 0
P 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player (P) starts at coordinates (1, 0).
- The goal (G) is at coordinates (4, 3).
- The empty spaces form a "U" shape, similar to the original maze.
