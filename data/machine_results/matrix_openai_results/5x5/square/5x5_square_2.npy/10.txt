You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the player and the goal.

The maze is:
```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
```

From the maze, we can see:
- The player (P) is at coordinates (3, 2).
- The goal (G) is at coordinates (0, 2).

We need to find a path from (3, 2) to (0, 2). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (3, 2):

1. Up: (2, 2) - This is a wall.
2. Down: (4, 2) - This is a wall.
3. Left: (3, 1) - This is an empty space.
4. Right: (3, 3) - This is an empty space.

Since moving left or right are the only valid moves, let's choose to move left to (3, 1).

So, the next move is to (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current state of the maze is:
```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (3, 1). Let's consider the possible moves from this position:

1. Up: (2, 1) - This is an empty space.
2. Down: (4, 1) - This is a wall.
3. Left: (3, 0) - This is a wall.
4. Right: (3, 2) - This is an empty space.

Since moving up or right are the only valid moves, let's choose to move up to (2, 1).

So, the next move is to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current state of the maze is:
```
1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (2, 1). Let's consider the possible moves from this position:

1. Up: (1, 1) - This is an empty space.
2. Down: (3, 1) - This is an empty space (where we came from).
3. Left: (2, 0) - This is a wall.
4. Right: (2, 2) - This is a wall.

Since moving up or down are the only valid moves, let's choose to move up to (1, 1).

So, the next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current state of the maze is:
```
1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (1, 1). Let's consider the possible moves from this position:

1. Up: (0, 1) - This is an empty space.
2. Down: (2, 1) - This is an empty space (where we came from).
3. Left: (1, 0) - This is a wall.
4. Right: (1, 2) - This is a wall.

Since moving up or down are the only valid moves, let's choose to move up to (0, 1).

So, the next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 P G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current state of the maze is:
```
1 P G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (0, 1). Let's consider the possible moves from this position:

1. Up: This move is not possible as it is out of bounds.
2. Down: (1, 1) - This is an empty space (where we came from).
3. Left: (0, 0) - This is a wall.
4. Right: (0, 2) - This is the goal (G).

Since moving right will take us to the goal, let's choose to move right to (0, 2).

So, the next move is to (0, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors)

The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "U" shape. The path starts from the bottom, goes up along the left side, and then moves right along the top row to reach the goal.

### (2) A New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form a "U" shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces and is not an identical copy of the original maze.

```
1 1 1 0 G
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player (P) starts at the bottom left corner (4, 0).
- The goal (G) is at the top right corner (0, 4).
- The empty spaces form a "U" shape, starting from the bottom left, moving up along the left side, and then moving right along the top row to reach the goal.
