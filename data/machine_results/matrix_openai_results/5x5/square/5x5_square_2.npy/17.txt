You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's first identify the coordinates of the player and the goal:

- Player position (P): (3, 2)
- Goal position (G): (0, 2)

We can move up, down, left, or right to navigate through the maze. Let's find the next move:

1. From (3, 2), we can move up to (2, 2), down to (4, 2), left to (3, 1), or right to (3, 3).
2. Checking the maze, the possible moves are:
   - Up to (2, 2): This is a wall ('1').
   - Down to (4, 2): This is a wall ('1').
   - Left to (3, 1): This is an empty space ('0').
   - Right to (3, 3): This is an empty space ('0').

Since moving left or right are the only valid moves, let's choose to move left to (3, 1).

So, the next move is to the coordinates (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's identify the current player position and the goal position again:

- Current player position (P): (3, 1)
- Goal position (G): (0, 2)

From (3, 1), we can move up to (2, 1), down to (4, 1), left to (3, 0), or right to (3, 2).

Checking the maze, the possible moves are:
- Up to (2, 1): This is an empty space ('0').
- Down to (4, 1): This is a wall ('1').
- Left to (3, 0): This is a wall ('1').
- Right to (3, 2): This is an empty space ('0').

Since moving up or right are the only valid moves, let's choose to move up to (2, 1).

So, the next move is to the coordinates (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's identify the current player position and the goal position again:

- Current player position (P): (2, 1)
- Goal position (G): (0, 2)

From (2, 1), we can move up to (1, 1), down to (3, 1), left to (2, 0), or right to (2, 2).

Checking the maze, the possible moves are:
- Up to (1, 1): This is an empty space ('0').
- Down to (3, 1): This is an empty space ('0').
- Left to (2, 0): This is a wall ('1').
- Right to (2, 2): This is a wall ('1').

Since moving up or down are the only valid moves, let's choose to move up to (1, 1).

So, the next move is to the coordinates (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's identify the current player position and the goal position again:

- Current player position (P): (1, 1)
- Goal position (G): (0, 2)

From (1, 1), we can move up to (0, 1), down to (2, 1), left to (1, 0), or right to (1, 2).

Checking the maze, the possible moves are:
- Up to (0, 1): This is an empty space ('0').
- Down to (2, 1): This is an empty space ('0').
- Left to (1, 0): This is a wall ('1').
- Right to (1, 2): This is a wall ('1').

Since moving up or down are the only valid moves, let's choose to move up to (0, 1).

So, the next move is to the coordinates (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 P G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's identify the current player position and the goal position again:

- Current player position (P): (0, 1)
- Goal position (G): (0, 2)

From (0, 1), we can move up (which is out of bounds), down to (1, 1), left to (0, 0), or right to (0, 2).

Checking the maze, the possible moves are:
- Down to (1, 1): This is an empty space ('0').
- Left to (0, 0): This is a wall ('1').
- Right to (0, 2): This is the goal ('G').

Since moving right to (0, 2) will take us to the goal, let's choose to move right to (0, 2).

So, the next move is to the coordinates (0, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "L" shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 G 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at (1, 0) and the goal is at (4, 3).
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze.
- There is a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G) through the empty spaces.
