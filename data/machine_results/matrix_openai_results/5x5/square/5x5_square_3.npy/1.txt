You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the current player position and the goal position.

The current player position (P) is at (4, 3).
The goal position (G) is at (2, 4).

We can move to any adjacent empty space (0). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (4, 3):

1. Up to (3, 3) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
2. Down to (5, 3) - This is outside the maze, so it's not a valid move.
3. Left to (4, 2) - This is an empty space (0), so it's a valid move.
4. Right to (4, 4) - This is an empty space (0), so it's a valid move.

We have two valid moves: (4, 2) and (4, 4). To get closer to the goal, let's move to (4, 2).

So, the next move is to the coordinates (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the current state of the maze and determine the next move. The current player position (P) is now at (4, 2).

From (4, 2), the possible moves are:

1. Up to (3, 2) - This is an empty space (0), so it's a valid move.
2. Down to (5, 2) - This is outside the maze, so it's not a valid move.
3. Left to (4, 1) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
4. Right to (4, 3) - This is an empty space (0), so it's a valid move.

We have two valid moves: (3, 2) and (4, 3). To get closer to the goal, let's move to (3, 2).

So, the next move is to the coordinates (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 P 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the current state of the maze and determine the next move. The current player position (P) is now at (3, 2).

From (3, 2), the possible moves are:

1. Up to (2, 2) - This is an empty space (0), so it's a valid move.
2. Down to (4, 2) - This is an empty space (0), but we just came from there.
3. Left to (3, 1) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
4. Right to (3, 3) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.

We have one valid move that gets us closer to the goal: (2, 2).

So, the next move is to the coordinates (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

From (2, 2), the possible moves are:

2. Down to (3, 2) - This is an empty space (0), but we just came from there.

1 1 0 P G

4. Right to (2, 4) - This is the goal (G), so it's a valid move.

We have one valid move that reaches the goal: (2, 4).

So, the next move is to the coordinates (2, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape Formed by the Empty Spaces (Corridors)

The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze can be described as a "Z" shape. The path starts at the bottom left, moves up, then right, and finally up again to reach the goal.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G:

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0
P 0 0 1 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at the bottom left (P) at (4, 0).
- The goal (G) is at the bottom right (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form a "Z" shape, providing a valid path from P to G.
