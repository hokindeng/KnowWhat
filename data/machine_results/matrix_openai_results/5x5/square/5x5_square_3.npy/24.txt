You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the current player position and the goal position.

The current player position (P) is at (4, 3).
The goal position (G) is at (2, 4).

We can move to any adjacent empty space (0). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (4, 3):

1. Up to (3, 3) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
2. Down to (5, 3) - This is outside the maze, so it's not a valid move.
3. Left to (4, 2) - This is an empty space (0), so it's a valid move.
4. Right to (4, 4) - This is an empty space (0), so it's a valid move.

We have two valid moves: (4, 2) and (4, 4). To get closer to the goal, let's move to (4, 2).

So, the next move is to the coordinates (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the current state of the maze and determine the next move. The current player position (P) is now at (4, 2), and the goal position (G) is still at (2, 4).

From the current position (4, 2), we can consider the following possible moves:

1. Up to (3, 2) - This is an empty space (0), so it's a valid move.
2. Down to (5, 2) - This is outside the maze, so it's not a valid move.
3. Left to (4, 1) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
4. Right to (4, 3) - This is an empty space (0), so it's a valid move.

We have two valid moves: (3, 2) and (4, 3). To get closer to the goal, let's move up to (3, 2).

So, the next move is to the coordinates (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 P 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

From the current position (3, 2), we can consider the following possible moves:

1. Up to (2, 2) - This is an empty space (0), so it's a valid move.
2. Down to (4, 2) - This is an empty space (0), but we just came from there, so it's not the best move.
3. Left to (3, 1) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
4. Right to (3, 3) - This is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.

The only valid move that gets us closer to the goal is up to (2, 2).

So, the next move is to the coordinates (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 G
1 1 0 1 0

The valid move that gets us closer to the goal is to the right to (2, 3).

So, the next move is to the coordinates (2, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form an "L" shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces and is not an identical copy of the original maze:

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at (2, 0) and the goal is at (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze.
