You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the player and the goal.

The maze is:
```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
```

The coordinates of 'P' (player) are (3, 1).
The coordinates of 'G' (goal) are (1, 3).

We can move to any adjacent empty space (0). Let's find the next move.

From (3, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up to (2, 1)
- Down to (4, 1)
- Left to (3, 0) (not possible, it's a wall)
- Right to (3, 2) (not possible, it's a wall)

The only valid move is down to (4, 1).

So, the next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the current state of the maze and determine the next move.

The maze is now:
```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1
```

The coordinates of 'P' (player) are now (4, 1).
The coordinates of 'G' (goal) are still (1, 3).

From (4, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 1) (not possible, already visited)
- Down to (5, 1) (not possible, out of bounds)
- Left to (4, 0) (not possible, it's a wall)
- Right to (4, 2) (possible, it's an empty space)

The valid move is to the right to (4, 2).

So, the next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the current state of the maze and determine the next move.

The maze is now:
```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 1
```

The coordinates of 'P' (player) are now (4, 2).
The coordinates of 'G' (goal) are still (1, 3).

From (4, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 2) (not possible, it's a wall)
- Down to (5, 2) (not possible, out of bounds)
- Left to (4, 1) (not possible, already visited)
- Right to (4, 3) (possible, it's an empty space)

The valid move is to the right to (4, 3).

So, the next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the current state of the maze and determine the next move.

The maze is now:
```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 1
```

The coordinates of 'P' (player) are now (4, 3).
The coordinates of 'G' (goal) are still (1, 3).

From (4, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 3) (not possible, it's a wall)
- Down to (5, 3) (not possible, out of bounds)
- Left to (4, 2) (not possible, already visited)
- Right to (4, 4) (not possible, it's a wall)

It seems I made an error in the previous steps. Let's backtrack to find a valid path.

From (4, 2), the possible moves should have been:
- Up to (3, 2) (not possible, it's a wall)
- Down to (5, 2) (not possible, out of bounds)
- Left to (4, 1) (not possible, already visited)
- Right to (4, 3) (possible, it's an empty space)

Since moving to (4, 3) led to a dead end, let's backtrack to (4, 2) and consider other options.

From (4, 2), the only valid move is to (4, 1), which we have already visited. Therefore, we need to backtrack further.

From (4, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 1) (possible, it's an empty space)
- Down to (5, 1) (not possible, out of bounds)
- Left to (4, 0) (not possible, it's a wall)
- Right to (4, 2) (already visited)

So, let's move up to (3, 1).

The next move is to (3, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze. The original maze is:

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
```

The empty spaces form a shape that resembles the letter "T". 

Now, let's create a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "T" shape. The new maze should include a valid path from 'P' to 'G' and should not be an identical copy of the original maze.

Here is the new maze:

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at (4, 1) (P).
- The goal is at (4, 3) (G).
- The empty spaces form a "T" shape, similar to the original maze.

This new maze meets the criteria specified.
