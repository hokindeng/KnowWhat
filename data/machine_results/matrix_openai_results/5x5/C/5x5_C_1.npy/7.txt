You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the player and the goal.

The maze is:
```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
```

From the maze, we can see:
- The player (P) is at coordinates (3, 1).
- The goal (G) is at coordinates (1, 3).

We can move to any adjacent empty space (0). Let's find the next move.

From (3, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up to (2, 1)
- Down to (4, 1)
- Left to (3, 0) (which is a wall, so not possible)
- Right to (3, 2) (which is a wall, so not possible)

The only valid move is to move down to (4, 1).

So, the next move is to coordinates (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the current state of the maze and determine the next move:

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1
```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (4, 1). From this position, the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 1) (which is an empty space)
- Down to (5, 1) (which is out of bounds, so not possible)
- Left to (4, 0) (which is a wall, so not possible)
- Right to (4, 2) (which is an empty space)

We have two valid moves: up to (3, 1) and right to (4, 2). Moving right to (4, 2) seems to bring us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to coordinates (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 1

- Left to (4, 1) (which is an empty space)
- Right to (4, 3) (which is an empty space)

The valid move that brings us closer to the goal is to move right to (4, 3).

So, the next move is to coordinates (4, 3).

- Right to (4, 3) (which is an empty space)

Previously, we moved right to (4, 3) and then back to (4, 2). To make progress, let's try moving up to (3, 1) from (4, 2).

So, the next move is to coordinates (3, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape

The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Z" shape.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form a "Z" shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces and is not an identical copy of the original maze.

```
1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player (P) starts at coordinates (1, 0).
- The goal (G) is at coordinates (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form a "Z" shape, similar to the original maze.
