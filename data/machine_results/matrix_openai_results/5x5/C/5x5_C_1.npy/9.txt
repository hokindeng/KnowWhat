You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the current player position and the goal position.

The maze is:
```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
```

From the maze, we can see:
- The current player position (P) is at (3, 1).
- The goal position (G) is at (1, 3).

We can move to any adjacent empty space (0). Let's find the next move.

From (3, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up to (2, 1)
- Down to (4, 1)
- Left to (3, 0) (not possible, it's a wall)
- Right to (3, 2) (not possible, it's a wall)

The only valid move is to move down to (4, 1).

So, the next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 1) (not possible, it's already visited)
- Down to (5, 1) (not possible, it's outside the maze)
- Left to (4, 0) (not possible, it's a wall)
- Right to (4, 2) (possible, it's an empty space)

The only valid move is to move right to (4, 2).

So, the next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 2) (not possible, it's a wall)
- Down to (5, 2) (not possible, it's outside the maze)
- Left to (4, 1) (not possible, it's already visited)
- Right to (4, 3) (possible, it's an empty space)

The only valid move is to move right to (4, 3).

So, the next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 3) (not possible, it's a wall)
- Down to (5, 3) (not possible, it's outside the maze)
- Left to (4, 2) (not possible, it's already visited)
- Right to (4, 4) (not possible, it's a wall)

It seems I made an error in the previous steps. Let's backtrack to the previous position (4, 2) and re-evaluate the moves from there.

From (4, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 2) (not possible, it's a wall)
- Down to (5, 2) (not possible, it's outside the maze)
- Left to (4, 1) (not possible, it's already visited)
- Right to (4, 3) (already visited)

Since all moves from (4, 2) are either invalid or already visited, let's backtrack further to (4, 1).

From (4, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 1) (not possible, it's already visited)
- Down to (5, 1) (not possible, it's outside the maze)
- Left to (4, 0) (not possible, it's a wall)
- Right to (4, 2) (already visited)

Since all moves from (4, 1) are either invalid or already visited, let's backtrack further to (3, 1).

From (3, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up to (2, 1) (possible, it's an empty space)
- Down to (4, 1) (already visited)
- Left to (3, 0) (not possible, it's a wall)
- Right to (3, 2) (not possible, it's a wall)

The valid move is to move up to (2, 1).

So, the next move is to (2, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Z" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "Z" shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 G 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at (1, 1).
- The goal is at (4, 3).
- The empty spaces form a "Z" shape, similar to the original maze.
