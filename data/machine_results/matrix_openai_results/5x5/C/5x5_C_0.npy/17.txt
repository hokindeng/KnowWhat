You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G) by moving through empty spaces (0) and avoiding walls (1). Let's start by identifying the current position of the player and the goal position.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (0, 2).
The goal position (G) is at coordinates (3, 0).

We can move to any adjacent empty space (up, down, left, or right). Let's evaluate the possible moves from the current position (0, 2):

1. Move up: Not possible (out of bounds).
2. Move down: (1, 2) - Not possible (wall).
3. Move left: (0, 1) - Possible (empty space).
4. Move right: (0, 3) - Possible (empty space).

Given the options, let's move right to (0, 3).

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's evaluate the possible moves from the current position (0, 3):

1. Move up: Not possible (out of bounds).
2. Move down: (1, 3) - Not possible (wall).
3. Move left: (0, 2) - Possible (empty space).
4. Move right: Not possible (wall).

Given the options, let's move left to (0, 2).

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems I made an incorrect move by going back to the previous position. Let's re-evaluate the possible moves from the current position (0, 2):

1. Move up: Not possible (out of bounds).
2. Move down: (1, 2) - Not possible (wall).
3. Move left: (0, 1) - Possible (empty space).
4. Move right: (0, 3) - Possible (empty space).

Since moving right to (0, 3) didn't help, let's try moving left to (0, 1).

Next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's evaluate the possible moves from the current position (0, 1):

1. Move up: Not possible (out of bounds).
2. Move down: (1, 1) - Not possible (wall).
3. Move left: (0, 0) - Possible (empty space).
4. Move right: (0, 2) - Possible (empty space).

Given the options, let's move left to (0, 0).

Next move: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's evaluate the possible moves from the current position (0, 0):

1. Move up: Not possible (out of bounds).
2. Move down: (1, 0) - Possible (empty space).
3. Move left: Not possible (out of bounds).
4. Move right: (0, 1) - Possible (empty space).

Given the options, let's move down to (1, 0).

Next move: (1, 0)

G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's evaluate the possible moves from the current position (1, 0):

1. Move up: (0, 0) - Possible (empty space).
2. Move down: (2, 0) - Possible (empty space).
3. Move left: Not possible (out of bounds).
4. Move right: (1, 1) - Not possible (wall).

Given the options, let's move down to (2, 0).

Next move: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's evaluate the possible moves from the current position (2, 0):

1. Move up: (1, 0) - Possible (empty space).
2. Move down: (3, 0) - Possible (empty space, and it's the goal position).
3. Move left: Not possible (out of bounds).
4. Move right: (2, 1) - Not possible (wall).

Given the options, let's move down to (3, 0), which is the goal position.

Next move: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "L" shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at position (1, 0).
- The goal is at position (4, 3).
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze.
