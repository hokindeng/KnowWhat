You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G) by moving through empty spaces (0) and avoiding walls (1). Let's start by identifying the current position of the player and the goal:

Current player position (P): (0, 2)
Goal position (G): (3, 0)

We will use a step-by-step approach to find the path. The first move should be to an adjacent empty space. From the current position (0, 2), the possible moves are:

- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 2) (blocked by a wall)
- Left: (0, 1) (empty space)
- Right: (0, 3) (empty space)

Let's move to the right to (0, 3).

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), the possible moves are:

- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 3) (blocked by a wall)
- Left: (0, 2) (empty space)
- Right: Not possible (blocked by a wall)

Since moving left to (0, 2) would take us back to the previous position, let's consider moving down to (1, 3), but it's blocked by a wall. Therefore, the only viable move is to go back to (0, 2).

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since moving back to (0, 2) didn't help us progress, let's reconsider our options from the initial position (0, 2). We need to find a path that avoids walls and leads us closer to the goal.

From (0, 2), the possible moves are:

- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 2) (blocked by a wall)
- Left: (0, 1) (empty space)
- Right: (0, 3) (empty space, but we already tried this path)

Let's move left to (0, 1) and explore new possibilities.

Next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), the possible moves are:

- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 1) (blocked by a wall)
- Left: (0, 0) (empty space)
- Right: (0, 2) (empty space, but we already tried this path)

Let's move left to (0, 0) and explore new possibilities.

Next move: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 0), the possible moves are:

- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 0) (empty space)
- Left: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: (0, 1) (empty space, but we already tried this path)

Let's move down to (1, 0) and explore new possibilities.

Next move: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 0), the possible moves are:

- Up: (0, 0) (empty space, but we already tried this path)
- Down: (2, 0) (empty space)
- Left: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: (1, 1) (blocked by a wall)

Let's move down to (2, 0) and explore new possibilities.

Next move: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 0), the possible moves are:

- Up: (1, 0) (empty space, but we already tried this path)
- Down: (3, 0) (goal position G)
- Left: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: (2, 1) (blocked by a wall)

Let's move down to (3, 0) to reach the goal.

Next move: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "L" shape:

```
1 1 0 0 0
P 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at position (1, 0) and the goal is at position (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze.
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces.
