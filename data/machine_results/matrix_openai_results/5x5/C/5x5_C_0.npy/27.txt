You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G) by moving through empty spaces (0) and avoiding walls (1). Let's start by identifying the current position of the player and the goal:

Current player position (P): (0, 2)
Goal position (G): (3, 0)

From the current position (0, 2), we can move to the following adjacent positions:
- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 2) (blocked by a wall)
- Left: (0, 1) (empty space)
- Right: (0, 3) (empty space)

Given these options, let's move to the right to (0, 3).

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), we can move to the following adjacent positions:
- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 3) (blocked by a wall)
- Left: (0, 2) (empty space)
- Right: Not possible (blocked by a wall)

Given these options, let's move to the left to (0, 2).

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the mistake in my previous move. Let's correct the path. From the current position (0, 2), we should explore other options to move towards the goal.

From (0, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 2) (blocked by a wall)
- Left: (0, 1) (empty space)
- Right: (0, 3) (empty space)

Since moving to (0, 3) didn't help, let's try moving down from (0, 2) to (1, 2) and then explore further.

Next move: (1, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "L" shape:

```
1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 G 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at position (3, 0) and the goal is at position (4, 3).
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze.
- The maze is not an identical copy of the original maze but maintains the same recognizable "L" shape for the path.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
