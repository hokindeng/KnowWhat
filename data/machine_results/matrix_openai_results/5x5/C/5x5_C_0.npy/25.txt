You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G) by moving through empty spaces (0) and avoiding walls (1). Let's start by identifying the current position of the player and the goal.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (0, 2).
The goal position (G) is at coordinates (3, 0).

We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player to the goal. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible moves level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path.

Let's start by exploring the possible moves from the current position (0, 2):

1. Move up: (0 - 1, 2) = (-1, 2) - Invalid (out of bounds)
2. Move down: (0 + 1, 2) = (1, 2) - Invalid (wall)
3. Move left: (0, 2 - 1) = (0, 1) - Valid (empty space)
4. Move right: (0, 2 + 1) = (0, 3) - Valid (empty space)

We have two valid moves: (0, 1) and (0, 3). Let's choose one of them to proceed. We'll choose (0, 3) as it seems to be closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to coordinates (0, 3).

Please update the maze and provide the new state.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's continue solving the maze from the new player position (0, 3).

The current player position (P) is now at coordinates (0, 3).
The goal position (G) is still at coordinates (3, 0).

We will again explore the possible moves from the current position (0, 3):

1. Move up: (0 - 1, 3) = (-1, 3) - Invalid (out of bounds)
2. Move down: (0 + 1, 3) = (1, 3) - Invalid (wall)
3. Move left: (0, 3 - 1) = (0, 2) - Valid (empty space, but we came from there)
4. Move right: (0, 3 + 1) = (0, 4) - Invalid (wall)

The only valid move that we haven't just come from is to move left to coordinates (0, 2), but since we came from there, we need to explore other options. Since moving left to (0, 2) is not productive, we need to backtrack and explore other paths.

Let's backtrack to (0, 2) and then explore the other valid move from there, which is (0, 1).

So, the next move is to coordinates (0, 2).

Please update the maze and provide the new state.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1

3. Move left: (0, 2 - 1) = (0, 1) - Valid (empty space)
4. Move right: (0, 2 + 1) = (0, 3) - Valid (empty space, but we came from there)

The valid move that we haven't just come from is to move left to coordinates (0, 1).

So, the next move is to coordinates (0, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form an "L" shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and it is not an identical copy of the original maze:

```
1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at (2, 0) and the goal is at (4, 3).
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze.
