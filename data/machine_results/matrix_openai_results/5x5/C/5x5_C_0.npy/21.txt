You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G) by moving through empty spaces (0) and avoiding walls (1). Let's start by identifying the current position of the player and the goal.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (0, 2).
The goal position (G) is at coordinates (3, 0).

We can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent empty space. Let's find the next move.

From (0, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 2) which is a wall (1)
- Left: (0, 1) which is an empty space (0)
- Right: (0, 3) which is an empty space (0)

We have two possible moves: (0, 1) and (0, 3). Moving right to (0, 3) seems to be a better option as it keeps us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (0, 3).

Please update the maze and provide the new configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 3) which is a wall (1)
- Left: (0, 2) which is an empty space (0)
- Right: Not possible (out of bounds)

The only possible move is to go left to (0, 2).

So, the next move is to (0, 2).

Please update the maze and provide the new configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Let's re-evaluate the situation from the current position (0, 3):

From (0, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 3) which is a wall (1)
- Left: (0, 2) which is an empty space (0)
- Right: Not possible (out of bounds)

Since moving left to (0, 2) brings us back to the previous position, let's consider the next best move from (0, 2):

From (0, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 2) which is a wall (1)
- Left: (0, 1) which is an empty space (0)
- Right: (0, 3) which is an empty space (0)

Given that moving right to (0, 3) leads us back to the previous position, let's move left to (0, 1).

So, the next move is to (0, 1).

Please update the maze and provide the new configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 1) which is a wall (1)
- Left: (0, 0) which is an empty space (0)
- Right: (0, 2) which is an empty space (0)

Given that moving right to (0, 2) brings us back to the previous position, let's move left to (0, 0).

So, the next move is to (0, 0).

Please update the maze and provide the new configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 0) which is an empty space (0)
- Left: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: (0, 1) which is an empty space (0)

Moving down to (1, 0) seems to be a good option as it brings us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (1, 0).

Please update the maze and provide the new configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up: (0, 0) which is an empty space (0)
- Down: (2, 0) which is an empty space (0)
- Left: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: (1, 1) which is a wall (1)

Moving down to (2, 0) seems to be the best option as it brings us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (2, 0).

Please update the maze and provide the new configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up: (1, 0) which is an empty space (0)
- Down: (3, 0) which is the goal (G)
- Left: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: (2, 1) which is a wall (1)

Moving down to (3, 0) will take us directly to the goal.

So, the next move is to (3, 0).

Please update the maze and confirm that we have reached the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form an "L" shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces:

```
1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at (1, 0) and the goal is at (4, 3).
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze.
