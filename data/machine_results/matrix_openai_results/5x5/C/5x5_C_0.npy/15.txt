You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G) by moving through empty spaces (0) and avoiding walls (1). Let's start by identifying the current position of the player and the goal.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (0, 2).
The goal position (G) is at coordinates (3, 0).

We will use a step-by-step approach to find the path. Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (0, 2):

1. Move up to (0, 1) - Not possible (out of bounds).
2. Move down to (1, 2) - Not possible (wall).
3. Move left to (0, 1) - Possible (empty space).
4. Move right to (0, 3) - Possible (empty space).

Given these options, let's move right to (0, 3).

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (0, 3):

1. Move up to (-1, 3) - Not possible (out of bounds).
2. Move down to (1, 3) - Not possible (wall).
3. Move left to (0, 2) - Possible (empty space).
4. Move right to (0, 4) - Not possible (wall).

Given these options, let's move left to (0, 2).

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems we have moved back to the previous position. Let's reconsider our options from the current position (0, 2):

1. Move up to (-1, 2) - Not possible (out of bounds).
2. Move down to (1, 2) - Not possible (wall).
3. Move left to (0, 1) - Possible (empty space).
4. Move right to (0, 3) - Possible (empty space).

Since moving right to (0, 3) didn't help us previously, let's try moving left to (0, 1).

Next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (0, 1):

1. Move up to (-1, 1) - Not possible (out of bounds).
2. Move down to (1, 1) - Not possible (wall).
3. Move left to (0, 0) - Possible (empty space).
4. Move right to (0, 2) - Possible (empty space).

Since moving right to (0, 2) would take us back to a previous position, let's try moving left to (0, 0).

Next move: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (0, 0):

1. Move up to (-1, 0) - Not possible (out of bounds).
2. Move down to (1, 0) - Possible (empty space).
3. Move left to (0, -1) - Not possible (out of bounds).
4. Move right to (0, 1) - Possible (empty space).

Since moving right to (0, 1) would take us back to a previous position, let's try moving down to (1, 0).

Next move: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (1, 0):

1. Move up to (0, 0) - Possible (empty space).
2. Move down to (2, 0) - Possible (empty space).
3. Move left to (1, -1) - Not possible (out of bounds).
4. Move right to (1, 1) - Not possible (wall).

Since moving up to (0, 0) would take us back to a previous position, let's try moving down to (2, 0).

Next move: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (2, 0):

1. Move up to (1, 0) - Possible (empty space).
2. Move down to (3, 0) - Possible (empty space, and it's the goal position).
3. Move left to (2, -1) - Not possible (out of bounds).
4. Move right to (2, 1) - Not possible (wall).

Since moving down to (3, 0) will take us to the goal position, let's move down to (3, 0).

Next move: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "L" shape:

```
1 1 1 0 0
P 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at (1, 0) and the goal is at (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze.
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces.
