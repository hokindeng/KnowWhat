You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the player and the goal.

The player (P) is at coordinates (4, 1).
The goal (G) is at coordinates (0, 1).

We need to find a path from (4, 1) to (0, 1). Let's consider the possible moves:

1. Move up to (3, 1)
2. Move down to (5, 1) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 0)
4. Move right to (4, 2)

Since moving up to (3, 1) leads to a wall, we should consider moving left or right. Moving left to (4, 0) is an empty space, so let's make that move.

Next move: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's evaluate the current position and the possible moves from there.

The player (P) is now at coordinates (4, 0).

Possible moves:
1. Move up to (3, 0)
2. Move down to (5, 0) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, -1) - not possible, out of bounds
4. Move right to (4, 1)

Since moving up to (3, 0) and moving right to (4, 1) are the only valid moves, let's consider them. Moving up to (3, 0) is an empty space, so let's make that move.

Next move: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's evaluate the current position and the possible moves from there.

The player (P) is now at coordinates (3, 0).

Possible moves:
1. Move up to (2, 0)
2. Move down to (4, 0) - already visited
3. Move left to (3, -1) - not possible, out of bounds
4. Move right to (3, 1) - not possible, wall

Since moving up to (2, 0) is the only valid move, let's make that move.

Next move: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's evaluate the current position and the possible moves from there.

The player (P) is now at coordinates (2, 0).

Possible moves:
1. Move up to (1, 0)
2. Move down to (3, 0) - already visited
3. Move left to (2, -1) - not possible, out of bounds
4. Move right to (2, 1) - not possible, wall

Since moving up to (1, 0) is the only valid move, let's make that move.

Next move: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's evaluate the current position and the possible moves from there.

The player (P) is now at coordinates (1, 0).

Possible moves:
1. Move up to (0, 0)
2. Move down to (2, 0) - already visited
3. Move left to (1, -1) - not possible, out of bounds
4. Move right to (1, 1) - not possible, wall

Since moving up to (0, 0) is the only valid move, let's make that move.

Next move: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's evaluate the current position and the possible moves from there.

The player (P) is now at coordinates (0, 0).

Possible moves:
1. Move up to (-1, 0) - not possible, out of bounds
2. Move down to (1, 0) - already visited
3. Move left to (0, -1) - not possible, out of bounds
4. Move right to (0, 1)

Since moving right to (0, 1) is an empty space and it is also the goal (G), let's make that move.

Next move: (0, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors)

The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "L" shape. The path starts from the bottom left corner, moves up to the top row, and then moves right to the goal.

### (2) New Maze with the Same "L" Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming an "L" shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces.

```
1 1 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player (P) starts at (1, 0).
- The goal (G) is at (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze.
