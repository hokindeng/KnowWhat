You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the player and the goal.

The player (P) is at coordinates (4, 1).
The goal (G) is at coordinates (0, 1).

We need to find a path from (4, 1) to (0, 1). Let's consider the possible moves:

1. Up: (3, 1)
2. Down: (5, 1) - not possible as it is outside the maze
3. Left: (4, 0)
4. Right: (4, 2)

From (4, 1), moving up to (3, 1) is not possible because it is a wall. Moving down is not possible because it is outside the maze. Moving left to (4, 0) is possible because it is an empty space. Moving right to (4, 2) is also possible because it is an empty space.

Let's move to (4, 0).

So, the next move is to coordinates (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the current state of the maze and determine the next move. The player (P) is now at coordinates (4, 0), and the goal (G) is still at coordinates (0, 1).

From (4, 0), the possible moves are:

1. Up: (3, 0)
2. Down: (5, 0) - not possible as it is outside the maze
3. Left: (4, -1) - not possible as it is outside the maze
4. Right: (4, 1)

Moving up to (3, 0) is possible because it is an empty space. Moving down and left are not possible because they are outside the maze. Moving right to (4, 1) is also possible because it is an empty space.

Let's move up to (3, 0).

So, the next move is to coordinates (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the current state of the maze and determine the next move. The player (P) is now at coordinates (3, 0), and the goal (G) is still at coordinates (0, 1).

From (3, 0), the possible moves are:

1. Up: (2, 0)
2. Down: (4, 0) - already visited
3. Left: (3, -1) - not possible as it is outside the maze
4. Right: (3, 1) - not possible as it is a wall

Moving up to (2, 0) is possible because it is an empty space. Moving down is not ideal as it leads back to the previous position. Moving left and right are not possible.

Let's move up to (2, 0).

So, the next move is to coordinates (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the current state of the maze and determine the next move. The player (P) is now at coordinates (2, 0), and the goal (G) is still at coordinates (0, 1).

From (2, 0), the possible moves are:

1. Up: (1, 0)
2. Down: (3, 0) - already visited
3. Left: (2, -1) - not possible as it is outside the maze
4. Right: (2, 1) - not possible as it is a wall

Moving up to (1, 0) is possible because it is an empty space. Moving down is not ideal as it leads back to the previous position. Moving left and right are not possible.

Let's move up to (1, 0).

So, the next move is to coordinates (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

2. Down: (2, 0) - already visited
3. Left: (1, -1) - not possible as it is outside the maze
4. Right: (1, 1) - not possible as it is a wall

Moving up to (0, 0) is possible because it is an empty space. Moving down is not ideal as it leads back to the previous position. Moving left and right are not possible.

Let's move up to (0, 0).

So, the next move is to coordinates (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the current state of the maze and determine the next move. The player (P) is now at coordinates (0, 0), and the goal (G) is at coordinates (0, 1).

From (0, 0), the possible moves are:

1. Up: (-1, 0) - not possible as it is outside the maze
2. Down: (1, 0) - already visited
3. Left: (0, -1) - not possible as it is outside the maze
4. Right: (0, 1)

Moving right to (0, 1) is possible and it is the goal position.

Let's move right to (0, 1).

So, the next move is to coordinates (0, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape

The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L" shape.

### (2) New Maze with the Same "L" Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form an "L" shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces and is not an identical copy of the original maze.

```
1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player (P) starts at coordinates (1, 0).
- The goal (G) is at coordinates (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze.
