You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the current player position and the goal position.

The maze is:
```
0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0
```

The coordinates of 'P' (current player position) are (4, 1).
The coordinates of 'G' (goal position) are (0, 1).

We need to find a path from (4, 1) to (0, 1). Let's consider the possible moves:

1. Move up to (3, 1)
2. Move down to (5, 1) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 0)
4. Move right to (4, 2)

Since moving up to (3, 1) leads to a wall, and moving down is out of bounds, we can either move left or right. Moving right to (4, 2) seems like a better option as it keeps us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (4, 2).

Please update the maze and present it again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The updated maze is:
```
0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0
```

The current player position 'P' is now at (4, 2).

Let's consider the possible moves from (4, 2):

1. Move up to (3, 2) - leads to a wall
2. Move down to (5, 2) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 1) - already visited
4. Move right to (4, 3) - empty space

The best move is to move right to (4, 3).

So, the next move is to (4, 3).

Please update the maze and present it again.

2. Move down to (5, 4) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 3) - already visited
4. Move right to (4, 5) - not possible, out of bounds

Since all the immediate moves are either blocked or out of bounds, we need to backtrack. The only viable move is to move left to (4, 3).

So, the next move is to (4, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape Formed by the Empty Spaces (Corridors)

The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze can be described as a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The path moves up and down while progressing horizontally.

### (2) A New Maze of the Same Size with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) that includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G' and forms a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern:

```
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
P 0 0 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at the bottom left corner (4, 0).
- The goal is at the bottom right corner (4, 4).
- The path follows a zigzag pattern similar to the original maze, moving horizontally and vertically through empty spaces.

This maze maintains the same general shape of the corridors while providing a different layout.
