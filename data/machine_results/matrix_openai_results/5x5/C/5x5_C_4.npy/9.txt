You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the player and the goal.

The initial maze is:
```
0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0
```

From the maze, we can see:
- The player (P) is at coordinates (4, 1).
- The goal (G) is at coordinates (0, 1).

We need to find a path from (4, 1) to (0, 1). Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (4, 1):

1. Move up to (3, 1) - This is a wall.
2. Move down to (5, 1) - This is out of bounds.
3. Move left to (4, 0) - This is an empty space.
4. Move right to (4, 2) - This is an empty space.

Given these options, let's move to the empty space at (4, 0).

The coordinates of the next move are (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the current state of the maze and determine the next move. The current maze is:
```
0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0
```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (4, 0). The goal (G) is still at coordinates (0, 1).

From the current position (4, 0), the possible moves are:

1. Move up to (3, 0) - This is an empty space.
2. Move down to (5, 0) - This is out of bounds.
3. Move left to (4, -1) - This is out of bounds.
4. Move right to (4, 1) - This is an empty space.

Given these options, let's move to the empty space at (3, 0).

The coordinates of the next move are (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

```

The player (P) is now at coordinates (3, 0). The goal (G) is still at coordinates (0, 1).

From the current position (3, 0), the possible moves are:

1. Move up to (2, 0) - This is an empty space.
2. Move down to (4, 0) - This is an empty space (where we came from).
3. Move left to (3, -1) - This is out of bounds.
4. Move right to (3, 1) - This is a wall.

Given these options, let's move to the empty space at (2, 0).

The coordinates of the next move are (2, 0).

0 G 0 0 0

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape

The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U" shape. The path starts at the bottom left, goes up the left side, and then moves right along the top row to reach the goal.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a "U" shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze.

```
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
P 0 0 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player (P) starts at the bottom left corner (4, 0).
- The goal (G) is at the bottom right corner (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form a "U" shape, starting from the bottom left, moving right along the bottom row, and then up the right side to reach the goal.
