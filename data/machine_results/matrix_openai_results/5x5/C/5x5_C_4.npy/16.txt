You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G) while avoiding walls. Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the current player position and the goal position.

The current player position (P) is at (4, 1).
The goal position (G) is at (0, 1).

We can move to any adjacent empty space (0) in the up, down, left, or right direction. Let's find the next move that brings us closer to the goal.

From (4, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 1) (which is a wall, so not possible)
- Down to (5, 1) (which is out of bounds, so not possible)
- Left to (4, 0) (which is an empty space)
- Right to (4, 2) (which is an empty space)

Since we need to move towards the goal at (0, 1), moving up is the most direct path. However, since moving up is blocked by a wall, we need to find an alternative path. Moving right to (4, 2) seems like a good option to start navigating around the walls.

Let's move to (4, 2).

Please update the maze with the new player position and present it again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 2) (which is a wall, so not possible)
- Down to (5, 2) (which is out of bounds, so not possible)
- Left to (4, 1) (which is an empty space, but we just came from there)
- Right to (4, 3) (which is an empty space)

Since moving up is blocked by a wall and moving down is out of bounds, the best option is to move right to (4, 3).

Let's move to (4, 3).

Please update the maze with the new player position and present it again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 3) (which is a wall, so not possible)
- Down to (5, 3) (which is out of bounds, so not possible)
- Left to (4, 2) (which is an empty space, but we just came from there)
- Right to (4, 4) (which is an empty space)

Since moving up is blocked by a wall and moving down is out of bounds, the best option is to move right to (4, 4).

Let's move to (4, 4).

Please update the maze with the new player position and present it again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 4) (which is a wall, so not possible)
- Down to (5, 4) (which is out of bounds, so not possible)
- Left to (4, 3) (which is an empty space, but we just came from there)
- Right to (4, 5) (which is out of bounds, so not possible)

Since all the immediate moves are either blocked or out of bounds, we need to backtrack to find an alternative path. The only viable move is to go back to (4, 3).

Let's move to (4, 3).

Please update the maze with the new player position and present it again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), let's re-evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 3) (which is a wall, so not possible)
- Down to (5, 3) (which is out of bounds, so not possible)
- Left to (4, 2) (which is an empty space, but we just came from there)
- Right to (4, 4) (which is an empty space, but we just came from there)

Since moving up, down, left, or right from (4, 3) doesn't provide a new path, we need to consider a different strategy. Let's backtrack further to explore other potential paths.

Let's move back to (4, 2).

Please update the maze with the new player position and present it again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1

Since moving up and down are not possible, and moving right takes us back to where we came from, the best option is to move left to (4, 0).

Let's move to (4, 0).

Please update the maze with the new player position and present it again.

Since moving down and left are out of bounds, and moving right takes us back to where we came from, the best option is to move up to (3, 0).

Let's move to (3, 0).

- Up to (-1, 0) (which is out of bounds, so not possible)
- Down to (1, 0) (which is an empty space, but we just came from there)
- Left to (0, -1) (which is out of bounds, so not possible)
- Right to (0, 1) (which is the goal position 'G')

Since the goal position 'G' is directly to the right, the best move is to move right to (0, 1).

Let's move to (0, 1).

Congratulations! You have reached the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape Formed by the Empty Spaces (Corridors)

The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "U-shape". The empty spaces create a path that starts at the bottom left, goes up along the left side, and then moves right along the top row to reach the goal.

### (2) A New Maze of the Same Size with the Same U-Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces forming a U-shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze.

```
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at the top left corner (0, 0).
- The goal is at the bottom right corner (4, 4).
- The empty spaces form a U-shape, starting from the top left, moving down along the left side, and then moving right along the bottom row to reach the goal.
