You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the player and the goal.

The player (P) is at coordinates (4, 1).
The goal (G) is at coordinates (0, 1).

We need to find a path from (4, 1) to (0, 1). Let's consider the possible moves:

1. Move up to (3, 1)
2. Move down to (5, 1) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 0)
4. Move right to (4, 2)

Since moving up to (3, 1) is blocked by a wall, and moving down is out of bounds, we can either move left or right. Moving left to (4, 0) is an empty space, so let's make that move.

Next move: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's evaluate the current position and the possible moves from there.

The player (P) is now at coordinates (4, 0).

Possible moves:
1. Move up to (3, 0)
2. Move down to (5, 0) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, -1) - not possible, out of bounds
4. Move right to (4, 1)

Since moving down and left are out of bounds, and moving up is blocked by a wall, the only valid move is to move right to (4, 1).

Next move: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It appears that moving right to (4, 1) has returned us to our previous position. Let's re-evaluate our strategy.

The player (P) is at coordinates (4, 1).

Possible moves:
1. Move up to (3, 1) - blocked by a wall
2. Move down to (5, 1) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 0) - previously visited
4. Move right to (4, 2)

Since moving up and down are not possible, and moving left returns us to a previously visited position, the only remaining option is to move right to (4, 2).

Next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player (P) is now at coordinates (4, 2).

Possible moves:
1. Move up to (3, 2) - blocked by a wall
2. Move down to (5, 2) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 1) - previously visited
4. Move right to (4, 3)

Since moving up and down are not possible, and moving left returns us to a previously visited position, the only remaining option is to move right to (4, 3).

Next move: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player (P) is now at coordinates (4, 3).

Possible moves:
1. Move up to (3, 3) - blocked by a wall
2. Move down to (5, 3) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 2) - previously visited
4. Move right to (4, 4)

Since moving up and down are not possible, and moving left returns us to a previously visited position, the only remaining option is to move right to (4, 4).

Next move: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player (P) is now at coordinates (4, 4).

Possible moves:
1. Move up to (3, 4) - blocked by a wall
2. Move down to (5, 4) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 3) - previously visited
4. Move right to (4, 5) - not possible, out of bounds

Since all possible moves are either blocked, out of bounds, or lead to previously visited positions, we need to backtrack to find a new path.

Let's backtrack to the previous position (4, 3).

Next move: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player (P) is now back at coordinates (4, 3).

Let's re-evaluate the possible moves from this position:

1. Move up to (3, 3) - blocked by a wall
2. Move down to (5, 3) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 2) - previously visited
4. Move right to (4, 4) - previously visited

Since all these moves either lead to previously visited positions or are blocked, we need to backtrack further.

Let's backtrack to the previous position (4, 2).

Next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0

3. Move left to (4, 0) - previously visited
4. Move right to (4, 2) - previously visited

Since all these moves either lead to previously visited positions or are blocked, we need to consider a different strategy. Let's backtrack further to the previous position (4, 0).

Next move: (4, 0)

2. Move down to (5, 0) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, -1) - not possible, out of bounds
4. Move right to (4, 1) - previously visited

Since moving down and left are out of bounds, and moving right returns us to a previously visited position, the only remaining option is to move up to (3, 0).

Next move: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

2. Move down to (4, 0) - previously visited
3. Move left to (3, -1) - not possible, out of bounds
4. Move right to (3, 1) - blocked by a wall

Since moving down and left are not viable options, and moving right is blocked by a wall, the only remaining option is to move up to (2, 0).

Next move: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0

2. Move down to (1, 0) - previously visited
3. Move left to (0, -1) - not possible, out of bounds
4. Move right to (0, 1) - goal position (G)

Since the goal position (G) is to the right, the next move should be to move right to (0, 1).

Next move: (0, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape

The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L" shape.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form an "L" shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces.

```
1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player (P) starts at coordinates (1, 0).
- The goal (G) is at coordinates (4, 3).
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze.
