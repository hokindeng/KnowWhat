You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). Let's start by identifying the coordinates of the player and the goal.

The player (P) is at coordinates (4, 1).
The goal (G) is at coordinates (0, 1).

We need to find a path from (4, 1) to (0, 1). Let's consider the possible moves:

1. Move up to (3, 1)
2. Move down to (5, 1) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 0)
4. Move right to (4, 2)

Since moving up to (3, 1) leads to a wall, we should consider moving left or right. Moving left to (4, 0) is an empty space, so let's make that move.

Next move: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player (P) is now at coordinates (4, 0). Let's consider the possible moves:

1. Move up to (3, 0)
2. Move down to (5, 0) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, -1) - not possible, out of bounds
4. Move right to (4, 1)

Since moving up to (3, 0) and moving right to (4, 1) are the only valid moves, and moving right to (4, 1) leads to an empty space, let's make that move.

Next move: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player (P) is back at coordinates (4, 1). Let's reconsider the possible moves:

1. Move up to (3, 1) - leads to a wall
2. Move down to (5, 1) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 0) - already visited
4. Move right to (4, 2) - leads to an empty space

Since moving right to (4, 2) is the only valid move that leads to an empty space, let's make that move.

Next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0

Since moving right to (4, 3) is the only valid move that leads to an empty space, let's make that move.

3. Move left to (4, 2) - already visited
4. Move right to (4, 4) - leads to an empty space

2. Move down to (5, 4) - not possible, out of bounds
3. Move left to (4, 3) - already visited
4. Move right to (4, 5) - not possible, out of bounds

Since none of these moves are valid, we need to backtrack. Let's move left to (4, 3).

Next move: (4, 3)

Since all these moves have been explored, we need to backtrack further. Let's move left to (4, 2).

3. Move left to (4, 0) - already visited
4. Move right to (4, 2) - already visited

Since all these moves have been explored, we need to find a new path. Let's backtrack to the initial position and consider a different approach. 

The initial position was (4, 1). From there, we can try moving up to (3, 0) instead of moving left or right.

Next move: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) The General Shape Formed by the Empty Spaces (Corridors)

The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "L" shape. The path starts from the bottom left, moves up, and then turns right to reach the goal.

### (2) A New Maze of the Same Size with the Same "L" Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces forming an "L" shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces and is not an identical copy of the original maze.

```
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
P 0 0 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player (P) starts at the bottom left (4, 0).
- The goal (G) is at the bottom right (4, 4).
- The path forms an "L" shape, moving right from the start and then up to the goal.
