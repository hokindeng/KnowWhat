You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 P 1 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- 'P' is located at (3, 2).
- 'G' is located at (4, 0).

From the current position (3, 2), we can move to any adjacent empty space (0) in the up, down, left, or right direction. Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (2, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
2. Down to (4, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
3. Left to (3, 1) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
4. Right to (3, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.

The only valid move is to the left, to position (3, 1).

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 P 0 1 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (2, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
2. Down to (4, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
3. Left to (3, 0) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
4. Right to (3, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), but we just came from there.

The best move is to the left, to position (3, 0).

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
P 0 0 1 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (2, 0) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
2. Down to (4, 0) - This is the goal position ('G'), so we can move here.
3. Left to (3, -1) - This is out of bounds, so we cannot move here.
4. Right to (3, 1) - This is an empty space ('0'), but we just came from there.

The best move is down to position (4, 0), which is the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern is characterized by a series of connected horizontal and vertical segments that create a zigzagging path from the start to the goal.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar zigzag pattern. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze, the path from 'P' to 'G' follows a similar zigzag pattern, moving through the empty spaces while avoiding walls.
