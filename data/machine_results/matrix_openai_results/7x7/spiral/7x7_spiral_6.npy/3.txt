You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The player is currently at position (3, 2). Let's analyze the possible moves:

From (3, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up to (2, 2)
- Down to (4, 2)

Both positions (2, 2) and (4, 2) are empty spaces ('0'), so they are valid moves. To progress towards the goal, moving down to (4, 2) seems like a more direct path.

Let's move to (4, 2).

Please update the maze with this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is now at position (4, 2). From here, let's evaluate the possible moves:

From (4, 2), the possible moves are:
- Right to (4, 3)

Position (4, 3) is an empty space ('0'), so it is a valid move. Moving right will bring us closer to the goal.

Let's move to (4, 3).

From (4, 3), the possible moves are:
- Right to (4, 4)

Position (4, 4) is an empty space ('0'), so it is a valid move. Moving right will bring us closer to the goal.

Let's move to (4, 4).

From (4, 4), the possible moves are:
- Right to (4, 5)

Position (4, 5) is an empty space ('0'), so it is a valid move. Moving right will bring us closer to the goal.

Let's move to (4, 5).

From (4, 5), the possible moves are:
- Right to (4, 6)

Position (4, 6) is the goal ('G'), so moving right will allow us to reach the goal.

Let's move to (4, 6).

Please update the maze with this move.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape**: The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The path moves downwards and then horizontally, creating a series of turns that resemble steps.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape**:

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern:

```
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 G
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 P
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at position (6, 6) and the goal is at position (4, 6).
- The path follows a similar zigzag pattern, moving up and then horizontally, creating a recognizable staircase shape.
