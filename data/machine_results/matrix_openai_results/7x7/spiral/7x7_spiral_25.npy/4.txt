You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- 'P' is located at (5, 4).
- 'G' is located at (0, 4).

We can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent empty space ('0'). Let's find a path from 'P' to 'G'.

Starting from (5, 4), we can move up to (4, 4), but it's a wall. So, we need to find another path. Let's try moving left:

1. Move left to (5, 3).

Now, the maze looks like this:

```
0 0 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The next move should be to continue navigating towards the goal. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 3), we need to continue moving towards the goal 'G' at (0, 4). Let's explore the possible moves:

- Up to (4, 3) is a wall.
- Down is not possible as it is out of bounds.
- Left to (5, 2) is an empty space.
- Right to (5, 4) is an empty space.

To make progress towards the goal, let's move left to (5, 2).

Now, the maze will look like this:

```
0 0 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1

- Right to (3, 4) is a wall.

The only viable move is to go back up to (2, 3). However, to make progress towards the goal, we need to find a different path. Let's backtrack to (2, 3) and then explore other options.

Move up to (2, 3).

Now, the maze will look like this:

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "spiral" or "snail shell" pattern. The path starts at the bottom, moves left, then up, right, and finally up again towards the goal.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar spiral pattern:

```
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player 'P' starts at (5, 5).
- The goal 'G' is at (0, 4).
- The path follows a similar spiral pattern, starting from the bottom, moving left, then up, right, and finally up again to reach the goal.
