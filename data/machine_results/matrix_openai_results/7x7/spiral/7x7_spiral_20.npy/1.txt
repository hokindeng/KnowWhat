You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
P 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The player is currently at the bottom of the maze at position (6, 0). The goal 'G' is located at position (3, 0).

Let's find a path from 'P' to 'G'. We can move up, down, left, or right, but we must avoid walls ('1').

Starting at (6, 0), the possible moves are:
- Up to (5, 0)

Let's move up to (5, 0).

The next move is to go up to (4, 0).

The next move is to go up to (3, 0), which is the goal position.

Here is the step-by-step solution:
1. Move from (6, 0) to (5, 0)
2. Move from (5, 0) to (4, 0)
3. Move from (4, 0) to (3, 0)

The first move is to (5, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 1 0
P 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is currently at position (5, 0). The goal 'G' is at position (3, 0). Let's continue moving towards the goal.

From (5, 0), the possible moves are:
- Up to (4, 0)

Let's move up to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is currently at position (4, 0). The goal 'G' is at position (3, 0). Let's continue moving towards the goal.

From (4, 0), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 0)

Let's move up to (3, 0), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The path moves vertically and horizontally in a step-like fashion.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern:

```
P 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player 'P' starts at position (0, 0).
- The goal 'G' is at position (6, 6).
- The empty spaces form a similar zigzag pattern, allowing a path from 'P' to 'G'.
