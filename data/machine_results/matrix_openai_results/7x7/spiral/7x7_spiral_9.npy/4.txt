You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 G 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (5, 2). We can move to any adjacent empty space ('0') in the up, down, left, or right direction.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (5, 2):

- Up to (4, 2): This is an empty space ('0').
- Down to (6, 2): This is an empty space ('0').
- Left to (5, 1): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Right to (5, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.

The possible moves are:
1. Up to (4, 2)
2. Down to (6, 2)

To make progress towards the goal, let's move up to (4, 2).

The next move is to coordinates (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 G 1 0
1 1 P 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current position of 'P' is now at coordinates (4, 2). Let's analyze the possible moves from this position:

- Up to (3, 2): This is an empty space ('0').
- Down to (5, 2): This is where we came from, but it's an empty space ('0').
- Left to (4, 1): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Right to (4, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.

The possible moves are:
1. Up to (3, 2)
2. Down to (5, 2)

To continue making progress towards the goal, let's move up to (3, 2).

The next move is to coordinates (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 P 1 G 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current position of 'P' is now at coordinates (3, 2). Let's analyze the possible moves from this position:

- Up to (2, 2): This is an empty space ('0').
- Down to (4, 2): This is where we came from, but it's an empty space ('0').
- Left to (3, 1): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Right to (3, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.

The possible moves are:
1. Up to (2, 2)
2. Down to (4, 2)

To continue making progress towards the goal, let's move up to (2, 2).

The next move is to coordinates (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 G 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current position of 'P' is now at coordinates (2, 2). Let's analyze the possible moves from this position:

- Up to (1, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Down to (3, 2): This is where we came from, but it's an empty space ('0').
- Left to (2, 1): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Right to (2, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.

The only possible move is:
1. Down to (3, 2)

Since we need to backtrack to find another path, let's move down to (3, 2).

The next move is to coordinates (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current position of 'P' is now back at coordinates (3, 2). Let's analyze the possible moves from this position again:

- Up to (2, 2): This is where we came from, but it's an empty space ('0').
- Down to (4, 2): This is an empty space ('0').
- Left to (3, 1): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Right to (3, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.

The possible moves are:
1. Up to (2, 2)
2. Down to (4, 2)

Since moving up to (2, 2) leads to a dead end, let's move down to (4, 2) to explore a different path.

The next move is to coordinates (4, 2).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current position of 'P' is now at coordinates (4, 2). Let's analyze the possible moves from this position:

- Up to (3, 2): This is where we came from, but it's an empty space ('0').
- Down to (5, 2): This is an empty space ('0').
- Left to (4, 1): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Right to (4, 3): This is an empty space ('0').

The possible moves are:
1. Up to (3, 2)
2. Down to (5, 2)
3. Right to (4, 3)

To make progress towards the goal, let's move right to (4, 3).

The next move is to coordinates (4, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze. The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern, moving from the bottom left to the top right.

Now, let's create a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The new maze will have a valid path from 'P' to 'G' and will not be an identical copy of the original maze.

### New Maze:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 P 0 0 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern similar to the original maze.
- There is a valid path from 'P' at (6, 2) to 'G' at (6, 6).
- The maze is not an identical copy of the original maze.
