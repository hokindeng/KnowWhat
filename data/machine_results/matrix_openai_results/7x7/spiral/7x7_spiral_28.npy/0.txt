You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 P
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- 'P' is located at (1, 6).
- 'G' is located at (4, 2).

We can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent empty space ('0'). Let's find a path from 'P' to 'G'.

Starting from (1, 6), the possible moves are:
- Up to (0, 6) - blocked by a wall.
- Down to (2, 6) - open space.
- Left to (1, 5) - blocked by a wall.
- Right is out of bounds.

The only valid move is down to (2, 6).

So, the next move is to (2, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 P
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 6), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (1, 6) - open space.
- Down to (3, 6) - open space.
- Left to (2, 5) - blocked by a wall.
- Right is out of bounds.

The valid moves are up to (1, 6) or down to (3, 6). To progress towards the goal, let's move down to (3, 6).

The next move is to (3, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 6), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (2, 6) - open space.
- Down is out of bounds.
- Left to (3, 5) - blocked by a wall.
- Right is out of bounds.

The only valid move is up to (2, 6). However, to make progress towards the goal, let's consider the path from (3, 6) to (4, 6), which is open.

The next move is to (4, 6).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 6), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 6) - open space.
- Down is out of bounds.
- Left to (4, 5) - open space.
- Right is out of bounds.

The valid move that progresses towards the goal is left to (4, 5).

The next move is to (4, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves downwards, then to the left, and finally upwards to reach the goal.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
P 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at (1, 0).
- The goal is at (4, 6).
- The path follows a zigzag pattern, moving right, then down, and finally to the right again to reach the goal.
