You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 P 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (4, 3). We can move to any adjacent empty space ('0') in the up, down, left, or right direction.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (4, 3):

- Up to (3, 3): This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
- Down to (5, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
- Left to (4, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
- Right to (4, 4): This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.

We have two valid moves: (3, 3) and (4, 4). To progress towards the goal, let's move to the right to (4, 4).

The next move is to coordinates (4, 4).

The only valid move from this position is to move back down to (4, 3). However, since we've already been there, let's reconsider our path to find a new route towards the goal.

From (4, 3), we can move right to (4, 4) and then continue exploring from there. Let's move back down to (4, 3) and then plan to move right to (4, 4) again.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves in a zigzag manner from the top to the bottom of the maze.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" shape. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 G 0
```

In this new maze, the path from 'P' to 'G' still follows a zigzag pattern, but the layout of walls and empty spaces is different from the original maze.
