You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 G 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The player is currently at position (2, 2), and the goal is at position (2, 4). We can only move through empty spaces ('0') and avoid walls ('1').

Here's the current maze layout with coordinates:

```
(0,0) 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
(1,0) 1 1 0 1 1 1 1
(2,0) 1 1 P 1 G 0 0
(3,0) 1 1 0 1 1 1 0
(4,0) 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
(5,0) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
(6,0) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

From position (2, 2), the possible moves are:
- Right to (2, 3), but it's a wall ('1').
- Left to (2, 1), but it's a wall ('1').
- Up to (1, 2), which is an empty space ('0').
- Down to (3, 2), which is an empty space ('0').

To reach the goal, we should move down to (3, 2).

So, the next move is to position (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 0 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is now at position (3, 2). We need to continue moving towards the goal at position (2, 4).

Here's the current maze layout with coordinates:

```
(0,0) 1 1 0 0 0 0 0

(5,0) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
(6,0) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

From position (3, 2), the possible moves are:
- Right to (3, 3), but it's a wall ('1').
- Left to (3, 1), but it's a wall ('1').
- Up to (2, 2), which is an empty space ('0').
- Down to (4, 2), which is an empty space ('0').

To make progress towards the goal, we should move up to (2, 2).

So, the next move is to position (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is now back at position (2, 2). We need to continue moving towards the goal at position (2, 4).

Here's the current maze layout with coordinates:

From position (2, 2), the possible moves are:

- Left to (2, 1), but it's a wall ('1').
- Up to (1, 2), which is an empty space ('0').
- Down to (3, 2), which is an empty space ('0').

Since moving right to (2, 3) is blocked by a wall, let's try moving up to (1, 2) to explore a different path.

So, the next move is to position (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- Left to (1, 1), but it's a wall ('1').
- Up to (0, 2), which is an empty space ('0').
- Down to (2, 2), which is an empty space ('0').

Since moving right to (1, 3) is blocked by a wall, and moving left or up doesn't seem to lead towards the goal, let's move back down to (2, 2) and explore other options from there.

So, the next move is to position (2, 2).

Since moving right to (2, 3) is blocked by a wall, and moving left or up doesn't lead towards the goal, let's try moving down to (3, 2) again and explore further from there.

So, the next move is to position (3, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "U" shape. The path starts at the bottom left, goes up, then right, and finally down to the goal.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "U" shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
P 0 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 G
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at position (3, 0).
- The goal is at position (4, 6).
- The empty spaces form a "U" shape, starting from the bottom left, going up, then right, and finally down to the goal.
