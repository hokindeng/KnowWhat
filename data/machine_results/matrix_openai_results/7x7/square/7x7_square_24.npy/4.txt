You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- 'P' is located at (1, 4).
- 'G' is located at (0, 6).

We can move to any adjacent empty space ('0') in the up, down, left, or right direction. Let's find the path step-by-step.

From (1, 4), the possible moves are:
- Up to (0, 4)
- Right to (1, 5) (but it's a wall)
- Down to (2, 4)
- Left to (1, 3) (but it's a wall)

The only valid move is down to (2, 4).

Let's make the move to (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (1, 4) (already visited)
- Right to (2, 5)
- Down to (3, 4) (but it's a wall)
- Left to (2, 3) (but it's a wall)

The only valid move is to the right to (2, 5).

Let's move to (2, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 5), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (1, 5) (but it's a wall)
- Right to (2, 6)
- Down to (3, 5) (but it's a wall)
- Left to (2, 4) (already visited)

The only valid move is to the right to (2, 6).

Let's move to (2, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 6), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (1, 6)
- Right to (2, 7) (out of bounds)
- Down to (3, 6) (but it's a wall)
- Left to (2, 5) (already visited)

The only valid move is up to (1, 6).

Let's move to (1, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 0 1 P
1 1 1 1 0 0 0

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 6), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (0, 6) (which is the goal 'G')
- Right to (1, 7) (out of bounds)
- Down to (2, 6) (already visited)
- Left to (1, 5) (but it's a wall)

The valid move is up to (0, 6), which is the goal position.

Let's move to (0, 6).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles an "L" shape. The path starts at the bottom of the "L" and moves up, then turns right to reach the goal.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming an "L" shape. The maze is encoded in the same format as the original:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
P 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player 'P' starts at (2, 0).
- The goal 'G' is at (6, 6).
- The path forms an "L" shape, starting from the bottom left, moving right, and then turning down to reach the goal.
