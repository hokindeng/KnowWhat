You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (3, 2), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (6, 1).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (3, 2):

1. Move right to (3, 3) - This is an empty space.
2. Move down to (4, 2) - This is a wall.
3. Move diagonally down-right to (4, 3) - This is an empty space.

The best move is to move right to (3, 3) as it keeps us on the path towards the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move right to (3, 4) - This is an empty space.
2. Move down to (4, 3) - This is an empty space.
3. Move left to (3, 2) - This is an empty space (but moving back is not optimal).
4. Move diagonally down-right to (4, 4) - This is a wall.

The best move is to move down to (4, 3) as it keeps us on the path towards the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 3).

1 G 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move right to (4, 4) - This is a wall.
2. Move down to (5, 3) - This is a wall.
3. Move left to (4, 2) - This is a wall.
4. Move up to (3, 3) - This is an empty space (but moving back is not optimal).
5. Move diagonally down-left to (5, 2) - This is an empty space.

The best move is to move diagonally down-left to (5, 2) as it progresses us towards the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (5, 2).

1. Move right to (5, 3) - This is a wall.
2. Move down to (6, 2) - This is an empty space.
3. Move left to (5, 1) - This is a wall.
4. Move up to (4, 2) - This is a wall.
5. Move diagonally down-right to (6, 3) - This is an empty space.

The best move is to move down to (6, 2) as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (6, 2).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move right to (6, 3) - This is an empty space.
2. Move left to (6, 1) - This is the goal position 'G'.
3. Move up to (5, 2) - This is an empty space (but moving back is not optimal).

The best move is to move left to (6, 1) to reach the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (6, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves right, down diagonally, and then left to reach the goal.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1 1 G
```

In this new maze, the path starts at 'P' (6, 0), moves right to (6, 1), then up diagonally to (5, 2), continues up to (4, 2), moves right to (4, 3), and finally up to reach the goal 'G' at (6, 6). The path maintains a zigzag pattern similar to the original maze.
