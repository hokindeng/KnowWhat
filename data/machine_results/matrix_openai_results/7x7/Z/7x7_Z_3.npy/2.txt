You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (5, 1). The goal 'G' is located at (1, 0).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (5, 1):

- Up to (4, 1): This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
- Down to (6, 1): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
- Left to (5, 0): This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
- Right to (5, 2): This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-left to (4, 0): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
  - Up-right to (4, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
  - Down-left to (6, 0): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
  - Down-right to (6, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.

From the current position (5, 1), the valid moves are to (4, 1), (5, 0), and (5, 2). To make progress towards the goal, let's move to (4, 1).

The next move is to coordinates (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current position of 'P' is now at coordinates (4, 1). The goal 'G' is still at (1, 0).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (4, 1):

- Up to (3, 1): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
- Down to (5, 1): This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
- Left to (4, 0): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
- Right to (4, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-left to (3, 0): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
  - Up-right to (3, 2): This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
  - Down-left to (5, 0): This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
  - Down-right to (5, 2): This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.

From the current position (4, 1), the valid moves are to (5, 1), (3, 2), (5, 0), and (5, 2). To make progress towards the goal, let's move to (3, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze. The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern, moving diagonally from the bottom left to the top right.

### (1) Name of the General Shape:
The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape:
Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" pattern. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The path starts at 'P' at (5, 0) and ends at 'G' at (1, 6).
- The empty spaces form a zigzag pattern, similar to the original maze, but with a different configuration.
- The path is valid and can be navigated from 'P' to 'G' through the empty spaces.
