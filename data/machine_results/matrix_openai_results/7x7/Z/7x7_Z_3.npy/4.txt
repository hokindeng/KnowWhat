You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (5, 1), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (1, 0).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (5, 1):

- Up to (4, 1): This is an empty space ('0').
- Down to (6, 1): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
- Left to (5, 0): This is an empty space ('0').
- Right to (5, 2): This is an empty space ('0').
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-Left to (4, 0): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
  - Up-Right to (4, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
  - Down-Left to (6, 0): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
  - Down-Right to (6, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.

From the current position (5, 1), the best move is to go up to (4, 1), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 1): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
- Down to (5, 1): This is where we came from, but it's an empty space ('0').
- Left to (4, 0): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
- Right to (4, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-Left to (3, 0): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
  - Up-Right to (3, 2): This is an empty space ('0').
  - Down-Left to (5, 0): This is an empty space ('0').
  - Down-Right to (5, 2): This is an empty space ('0').

The best move from (4, 1) is to go diagonally up-right to (3, 2), which is an empty space and moves us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (2, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
- Down to (4, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
- Left to (3, 1): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
- Right to (3, 3): This is an empty space ('0').
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-Left to (2, 1): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
  - Up-Right to (2, 3): This is an empty space ('0').
  - Down-Left to (4, 1): This is an empty space ('0').
  - Down-Right to (4, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.

The best move from (3, 2) is to go right to (3, 3), which is an empty space and moves us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves diagonally and horizontally through the maze, creating a zigzag-like appearance.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at the top left corner (1, 0).
- The goal is at the bottom right corner (5, 6).
- The empty spaces form a zigzag path from the player to the goal, similar to the original maze's pattern.
