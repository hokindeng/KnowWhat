You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (5, 1), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (1, 0).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (5, 1):

- Up to (4, 1): This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
- Down to (6, 1): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
- Left to (5, 0): This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
- Right to (5, 2): This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-Left to (4, 0): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
  - Up-Right to (4, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
  - Down-Left to (6, 0): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
  - Down-Right to (6, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.

From these options, moving up to (4, 1) seems like a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal. Let's make that move.

The next move is to coordinates (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 1): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
- Down to (5, 1): This is an empty space ('0'), but we just came from there, so we should look for a move that progresses towards the goal.
- Left to (4, 0): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
- Right to (4, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-Left to (3, 0): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
  - Up-Right to (3, 2): This is an empty space ('0'), and it moves us closer to the goal.
  - Down-Left to (5, 0): This is an empty space ('0'), but it doesn't bring us closer to the goal.
  - Down-Right to (5, 2): This is an empty space ('0'), but it doesn't bring us closer to the goal.

The best move is diagonally up-right to (3, 2), as it brings us closer to the goal.

The next move is to coordinates (3, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves diagonally and horizontally, creating a zigzagging route from the start to the goal.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag shape. The maze is encoded using the same format as the original:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at (1, 0) and the goal is at (5, 6).
- The empty spaces form a zigzag pattern similar to the original maze, providing a valid path from 'P' to 'G'.
