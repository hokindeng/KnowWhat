You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at the bottom left corner, which is (6,0). The goal 'G' is located at (1,3).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (6,0):

- Up to (5,0): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
- Down: Not possible, as it would go out of bounds.
- Left: Not possible, as it would go out of bounds.
- Right to (6,1): This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
- Diagonal moves: 
  - Up-Right to (5,1): This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.

Given these options, let's move to (6,1) as the next step.

**Next move:** (6,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6,1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (5,1): This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
- Down: Not possible, as it would go out of bounds.
- Left to (6,0): This is an empty space ('0'), but it's the previous position, so we should avoid backtracking unless necessary.
- Right to (6,2): This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-Right to (5,2): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
  - Up-Left to (5,0): This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.

To make progress towards the goal, let's move to (5,1).

**Next move:** (5,1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape:** The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves diagonally and horizontally, creating a zigzag-like corridor through the maze.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7) with a zigzag pattern of empty spaces:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
P 0 0 0 0 G 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player 'P' starts at the bottom left corner (6,0).
- The goal 'G' is at the bottom right corner (6,5).
- The empty spaces form a zigzag pattern that allows a valid path from 'P' to 'G'.
