You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (0,3), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (0,1).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (0,3):

1. Up to (−1,3) - Out of bounds, not possible.
2. Down to (1,3) - Wall ('1'), not possible.
3. Left to (0,2) - Empty space ('0'), possible.
4. Right to (0,4) - Wall ('1'), not possible.
5. Diagonal up-left to (−1,2) - Out of bounds, not possible.
6. Diagonal up-right to (−1,4) - Out of bounds, not possible.
7. Diagonal down-left to (1,2) - Empty space ('0'), possible.
8. Diagonal down-right to (1,4) - Wall ('1'), not possible.

The possible moves are to (0,2) and (1,2). Moving to (0,2) brings us closer to the goal (0,1).

Let's move to (0,2).

The next move is to coordinates (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G P 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0,2), let's analyze the possible moves to reach the goal 'G' at (0,1):

1. Up to (−1,2) - Out of bounds, not possible.
2. Down to (1,2) - Empty space ('0'), possible.
3. Left to (0,1) - Goal ('G'), possible.
4. Right to (0,3) - Empty space ('0'), possible.
5. Diagonal up-left to (−1,1) - Out of bounds, not possible.
6. Diagonal up-right to (−1,3) - Out of bounds, not possible.
7. Diagonal down-left to (1,1) - Wall ('1'), not possible.
8. Diagonal down-right to (1,3) - Wall ('1'), not possible.

The possible moves are to (0,1), (1,2), and (0,3). Moving to (0,1) will reach the goal.

Let's move to (0,1).

The next move is to coordinates (0,1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape:**
   The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves diagonally and horizontally, creating a zigzag-like corridor through the maze.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

   Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" pattern. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

   ```
   1 1 1 0 1 1 1
   1 1 0 0 1 1 1
   1 0 1 1 1 1 1
   0 0 0 1 1 1 1
   1 1 0 1 1 1 1
   1 1 0 1 1 1 1
   1 1 0 G 0 0 P
   ```

In this new maze, the path from 'P' to 'G' follows a zigzag pattern similar to the original maze, but the layout and positions of walls and empty spaces have been altered to create a different configuration.
