You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position 'P' to the goal 'G'. The player's current position is at (4, 4), and the goal is at (6, 5). We can move to any adjacent empty space, including diagonals.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (4, 4):

- Up: (3, 4) is a wall.
- Down: (5, 4) is a wall.
- Left: (4, 3) is a wall.
- Right: (4, 5) is a wall.
- Diagonal Up-Left: (3, 3) is a wall.
- Diagonal Up-Right: (3, 5) is an empty space.
- Diagonal Down-Left: (5, 3) is an empty space.
- Diagonal Down-Right: (5, 5) is a wall.

The viable moves are to (3, 5) or (5, 3). To progress towards the goal, moving to (5, 3) seems more promising as it leads us closer to the goal.

Let's move to (5, 3).

Please update the maze with the new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up: (4, 3) is a wall.
- Down: (6, 3) is an empty space.
- Left: (5, 2) is a wall.
- Right: (5, 4) is a wall.
- Diagonal Up-Left: (4, 2) is a wall.
- Diagonal Up-Right: (4, 4) is an empty space.
- Diagonal Down-Left: (6, 2) is an empty space.
- Diagonal Down-Right: (6, 4) is an empty space.

The goal is at (6, 5), so moving to (6, 4) will bring us closer to the goal.

Let's move to (6, 4).

Please update the maze with the new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up: (5, 4) is a wall.
- Down: There is no row below (6, 4).
- Left: (6, 3) is an empty space.
- Right: (6, 5) is the goal 'G'.
- Diagonal Up-Left: (5, 3) is an empty space.
- Diagonal Up-Right: (5, 5) is a wall.
- Diagonal Down-Left: There is no row below (6, 3).
- Diagonal Down-Right: There is no row below (6, 5).

The goal is directly to the right at (6, 5). Let's move to (6, 5) to reach the goal.

Please update the maze with the new position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path starts at the bottom, moves up diagonally, and then continues horizontally and vertically in a zigzag manner.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" shape. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 0 G
```

In this new maze, the path starts at the bottom left, moves right, then up diagonally, and continues in a zigzag pattern to reach the goal 'G'.
