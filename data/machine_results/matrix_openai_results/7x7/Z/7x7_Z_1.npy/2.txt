You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (4, 4), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (6, 5). We can move to any adjacent empty space ('0').

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (4, 4):

1. Up to (3, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
2. Down to (5, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
3. Left to (4, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
4. Right to (4, 5) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
5. Diagonal up-left to (3, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
6. Diagonal up-right to (3, 5) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
7. Diagonal down-left to (5, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
8. Diagonal down-right to (5, 5) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.

The viable moves are to (3, 5) or (5, 3). To make progress towards the goal, let's move to (5, 3).

The next move is to coordinates (5, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (4, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
2. Down to (6, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
3. Left to (5, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
4. Right to (5, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
5. Diagonal up-left to (4, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
6. Diagonal up-right to (4, 4) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
7. Diagonal down-left to (6, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
8. Diagonal down-right to (6, 4) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.

To make progress towards the goal, let's move to (6, 4).

The next move is to coordinates (6, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (5, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
2. Down to (7, 4) - This is out of bounds, so we cannot move here.
3. Left to (6, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
4. Right to (6, 5) - This is the goal ('G'), so we can move here.
5. Diagonal up-left to (5, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
6. Diagonal up-right to (5, 5) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
7. Diagonal down-left to (7, 3) - This is out of bounds, so we cannot move here.
8. Diagonal down-right to (7, 5) - This is out of bounds, so we cannot move here.

The goal is directly to the right at (6, 5). Let's move to the goal.

The next move is to coordinates (6, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape**: The empty spaces in the original maze form an "L" shape. The path starts from the bottom left and moves right, then turns upwards.

2. **New Maze with the Same "L" Shape**:

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming an "L" shape. The path is different from the original, but it maintains the "L" shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player 'P' starts at (6, 0).
- The goal 'G' is at (6, 6).
- The path forms an "L" shape, starting from the bottom left, moving right, and then turning upwards.
