You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (3, 4), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (0, 5).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (3, 4):

- Up to (2, 4): This is an empty space ('0').
- Down to (4, 4): This is a wall ('1').
- Left to (3, 3): This is an empty space ('0').
- Right to (3, 5): This is an empty space ('0').
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-left to (2, 3): This is a wall ('1').
  - Up-right to (2, 5): This is a wall ('1').
  - Down-left to (4, 3): This is a wall ('1').
  - Down-right to (4, 5): This is a wall ('1').

From these options, the best move is to go right to (3, 5), as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current position of 'P' is now at coordinates (3, 5), and the goal 'G' is still at coordinates (0, 5).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (3, 5):

- Up to (2, 5): This is a wall ('1').
- Down to (4, 5): This is a wall ('1').
- Left to (3, 4): This is an empty space ('0').
- Right to (3, 6): This is an empty space ('0').
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-left to (2, 4): This is an empty space ('0').
  - Up-right to (2, 6): This is a wall ('1').
  - Down-left to (4, 4): This is a wall ('1').
  - Down-right to (4, 6): This is a wall ('1').

From these options, moving up-left to (2, 4) is a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current position of 'P' is now at coordinates (2, 4), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (0, 5).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (2, 4):

- Up to (1, 4): This is a wall ('1').
- Down to (3, 4): This is an empty space ('0').
- Left to (2, 3): This is a wall ('1').
- Right to (2, 5): This is a wall ('1').
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-left to (1, 3): This is a wall ('1').
  - Up-right to (1, 5): This is an empty space ('0').
  - Down-left to (3, 3): This is an empty space ('0').
  - Down-right to (3, 5): This is an empty space ('0').

From these options, moving up-right to (1, 5) is a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current position of 'P' is now at coordinates (1, 5), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (0, 5).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (1, 5):

- Up to (0, 5): This is the goal ('G').
- Down to (2, 5): This is a wall ('1').
- Left to (1, 4): This is a wall ('1').
- Right to (1, 6): This is a wall ('1').
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-left to (0, 4): This is an empty space ('0').
  - Up-right to (0, 6): This is an empty space ('0').
  - Down-left to (2, 4): This is an empty space ('0').
  - Down-right to (2, 6): This is a wall ('1').

The best move is to go up to (0, 5), which is the goal position.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves diagonally and horizontally, creating a zigzag-like shape from the starting position 'P' to the goal 'G'.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag pattern:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
P 0 1 1 1 1 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player 'P' starts at the bottom left corner (6, 0).
- The goal 'G' is at the bottom right corner (6, 6).
- The empty spaces form a zigzag path from 'P' to 'G', similar to the original maze's pattern.
