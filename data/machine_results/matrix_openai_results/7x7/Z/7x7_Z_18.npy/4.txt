You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (2, 1). The goal 'G' is located at coordinates (6, 3).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (2, 1):

- Up: (1, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Down: (3, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Left: (2, 0) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Right: (2, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal Up-Left: (1, 0) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal Up-Right: (1, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal Down-Left: (3, 0) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal Down-Right: (3, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.

The only valid move is to the right, to position (2, 2).

Let's move to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up: (1, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Down: (3, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Left: (2, 1) - This is an empty space ('0'), but we just came from there.
- Right: (2, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal Up-Left: (1, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal Up-Right: (1, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal Down-Left: (3, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal Down-Right: (3, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.

The best move is to the right, to position (2, 3).

Let's move to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up: (1, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Down: (3, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Left: (2, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), but we just came from there.
- Right: (2, 4) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal Up-Left: (1, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal Up-Right: (1, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal Down-Left: (3, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal Down-Right: (3, 4) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.

We have two options: move right to (2, 4) or move diagonally down-right to (3, 4). Moving diagonally down-right to (3, 4) seems to bring us closer to the goal.

Let's move to (3, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves in a zigzag manner from the top to the bottom of the maze.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" shape. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
P 0 0 0 1 G 1
```

In this new maze, the path from 'P' to 'G' still follows a zigzag pattern, but the layout of walls and empty spaces is different from the original maze.
