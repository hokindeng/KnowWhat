You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The player is currently at position (3, 1). Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **Up** to (2, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
2. **Down** to (4, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
3. **Left** to (3, 0) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
4. **Right** to (3, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's possible.
5. **Diagonally Up-Left** to (2, 0) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
6. **Diagonally Up-Right** to (2, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's possible.
7. **Diagonally Down-Left** to (4, 0) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
8. **Diagonally Down-Right** to (4, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.

The best move is to go **right** to (3, 2).

Let's move to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is now at position (3, 2). Let's analyze the possible moves from this position:

1. **Up** to (2, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's possible.
2. **Down** to (4, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
3. **Left** to (3, 1) - This is an empty space ('0'), but we just came from there.
4. **Right** to (3, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's possible.
5. **Diagonally Up-Left** to (2, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
6. **Diagonally Up-Right** to (2, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
7. **Diagonally Down-Left** to (4, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
8. **Diagonally Down-Right** to (4, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.

The best move is to go **right** to (3, 3).

Let's move to (3, 3).

The only viable move is to go **left** to (3, 3), but since we just came from there, let's consider moving **up** to (2, 3) to explore a new path.

Let's move **up** to (2, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task:

1. **Name of the General Shape**: The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern is characterized by a path that moves in a stepwise fashion, alternating directions as it progresses.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape**:

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

```
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
P 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player 'P' starts at position (5, 0).
- The goal 'G' is at position (6, 1).
- The path from 'P' to 'G' follows a similar zigzag pattern through the empty spaces ('0').
