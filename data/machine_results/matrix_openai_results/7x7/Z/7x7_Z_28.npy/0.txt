You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (3, 4), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (6, 3).

Let's evaluate the possible moves from the current position (3, 4):

1. Up to (2, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
2. Down to (4, 4) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
3. Left to (3, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
4. Right to (3, 5) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
5. Diagonal moves:
   - Up-left to (2, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
   - Up-right to (2, 5) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
   - Down-left to (4, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
   - Down-right to (4, 5) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.

From these options, let's choose to move left to (3, 3), as it brings us closer to the goal.

The next move is to coordinates (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (2, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
2. Down to (4, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
3. Left to (3, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
4. Right to (3, 4) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
5. Diagonal moves:
   - Up-left to (2, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
   - Up-right to (2, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
   - Down-left to (4, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
   - Down-right to (4, 4) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.

To continue progressing towards the goal, let's move diagonally down-right to (4, 4).

The next move is to coordinates (4, 4).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (3, 4) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
2. Down to (5, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
3. Left to (4, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
4. Right to (4, 5) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
5. Diagonal moves:

   - Down-right to (5, 5) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.

To continue progressing towards the goal, let's move diagonally down-left to (5, 3).

The next move is to coordinates (5, 3).

1. Up to (4, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
2. Down to (6, 3) - This is the goal ('G'), so it's a valid move and the optimal choice.
3. Left to (5, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
4. Right to (5, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.

The best move is to go directly down to the goal at (6, 3).

The next move is to coordinates (6, 3).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Congratulations! You have reached the goal position 'G' at coordinates (6, 3). There is no need for further moves as the objective of the maze has been achieved. If you have any other tasks or questions, feel free to ask!

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task:

1. **Name of the General Shape:**
   The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern is characterized by a series of connected diagonal and horizontal/vertical moves that create a zigzagging path.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**
   Below is a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains the zigzag pattern of empty spaces. The maze is encoded with '1' for walls, '0' for empty spaces, 'P' for the player start position, and 'G' for the goal position. The path from 'P' to 'G' follows a similar zigzag pattern but is not identical to the original maze.

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
P 0 1 1 1 1 G
```

In this new maze, the path from 'P' to 'G' still follows a zigzag pattern, moving through the empty spaces while avoiding walls.
