You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- 'P' is located at (2, 2).
- 'G' is located at (0, 4).

From the current position (2, 2), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are:

1. Up to (1, 2) - but this is a wall.
2. Down to (3, 2) - but this is a wall.
3. Left to (2, 1) - but this is a wall.
4. Right to (2, 3) - but this is a wall.
5. Diagonal up-left to (1, 1) - but this is a wall.
6. Diagonal up-right to (1, 3) - this is an empty space.
7. Diagonal down-left to (3, 1) - this is an empty space.
8. Diagonal down-right to (3, 3) - but this is a wall.

The only valid moves are to (1, 3) or (3, 1). To make progress towards the goal, let's move to (1, 3).

**Next move: (1, 3)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 4). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (0, 3) - this is an empty space.
2. Down to (2, 3) - but this is a wall.
3. Left to (1, 2) - but this is a wall.
4. Right to (1, 4) - but this is a wall.
5. Diagonal up-left to (0, 2) - this is an empty space.
6. Diagonal up-right to (0, 4) - this is the goal.
7. Diagonal down-left to (2, 2) - this is an empty space.
8. Diagonal down-right to (2, 4) - but this is a wall.

The best move is to go directly to the goal at (0, 4).

**Next move: (0, 4)**

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern is characterized by a series of connected diagonal and straight-line segments that create a path through the maze.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

```
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze, the path from 'P' to 'G' follows a similar zigzag pattern, moving diagonally and horizontally through the empty spaces.
