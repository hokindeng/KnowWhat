You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (2, 2), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (0, 4).

Let's evaluate the possible moves from the current position (2, 2):

1. Up to (1, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
2. Down to (3, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
3. Left to (2, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
4. Right to (2, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
5. Diagonal up-left to (1, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
6. Diagonal up-right to (1, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's possible.
7. Diagonal down-left to (3, 1) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's possible.
8. Diagonal down-right to (3, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.

The possible moves are to (1, 3) and (3, 1). To make progress towards the goal, let's move to (1, 3).

The next move is to coordinates (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current position of 'P' is now at coordinates (1, 3), and the goal 'G' is still at coordinates (0, 4).

Let's evaluate the possible moves from the current position (1, 3):

1. Up to (0, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's possible.
2. Down to (2, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
3. Left to (1, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
4. Right to (1, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
5. Diagonal up-left to (0, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's possible.
6. Diagonal up-right to (0, 4) - This is the goal ('G'), so it's possible.
7. Diagonal down-left to (2, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's possible.
8. Diagonal down-right to (2, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.

The possible moves are to (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 4), and (2, 2). Since moving to (0, 4) reaches the goal, let's move there.

The next move is to coordinates (0, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

In the original maze, the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The path moves diagonally and vertically, creating a zigzag-like corridor from the starting position 'P' to the goal 'G'.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Now, let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7) with a similar zigzag pattern of empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from 'P' to 'G' and will not be an identical copy of the original maze.

```
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
P 0 0 0 0 0 G
```

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form a zigzag pattern from the bottom left corner to the top right corner.
- The player 'P' starts at the bottom left (6, 0), and the goal 'G' is at the top right (6, 6).
- The path is different from the original maze but maintains the zigzag shape.
