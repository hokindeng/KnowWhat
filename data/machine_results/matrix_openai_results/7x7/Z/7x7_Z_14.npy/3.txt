You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- 'P' is located at (2, 3).
- 'G' is located at (0, 5).

We can move to any adjacent empty space ('0'), including diagonals. Let's examine the possible moves from the current position (2, 3):

1. Up to (1, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
2. Down to (3, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
3. Left to (2, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
4. Right to (2, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
5. Diagonal up-left to (1, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
6. Diagonal up-right to (1, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
7. Diagonal down-left to (3, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's possible.
8. Diagonal down-right to (3, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.

The only possible move is to (3, 2). Let's move there.

**Next move: (3, 2)**

3. Left to (3, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
4. Right to (3, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
5. Diagonal up-left to (2, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
6. Diagonal up-right to (2, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's possible.
7. Diagonal down-left to (4, 1) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's possible.
8. Diagonal down-right to (4, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's possible.

We have several possible moves: (4, 2), (2, 3), (4, 1), and (4, 3). To make progress towards the goal, let's move to (4, 3), which is closer to the goal.

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems we have returned to a previous position at (2, 3). Let's reevaluate our strategy to find a path towards the goal at (0, 5).

From the current position (2, 3), let's examine the possible moves:

1. Up to (1, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
2. Down to (3, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.

4. Right to (2, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
5. Diagonal up-left to (1, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
6. Diagonal up-right to (1, 4) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's possible.
7. Diagonal down-left to (3, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's possible.
8. Diagonal down-right to (3, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.

The move to (1, 4) seems promising as it brings us closer to the goal. Let's move diagonally up-right to (1, 4).

**Next move: (0, 5)**

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task:

1. **Name of the General Shape:**
   The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern is characterized by a series of connected diagonal and horizontal/vertical paths that create a zigzagging corridor through the maze.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

   Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7) with a similar zigzag pattern of empty spaces. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G' and is not an identical copy of the original maze:

   ```
   1 1 1 1 0 0 1
   1 1 1 0 0 1 1
   1 1 0 1 1 1 1
   1 0 0 1 1 1 1
   1 1 1 0 0 0 1
   1 1 1 1 1 0 1
   1 1 1 1 1 G 1
   ```

   In this new maze, the player 'P' starts at (3, 1) and the goal 'G' is at (6, 5). The path follows a zigzag pattern similar to the original maze, allowing movement through the empty spaces to reach the goal.
