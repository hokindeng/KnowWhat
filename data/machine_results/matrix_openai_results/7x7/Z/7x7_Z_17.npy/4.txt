You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position (P) to the goal (G) by moving through empty spaces (0) and avoiding walls (1). The player's current position is at (1, 2), and the goal is at (4, 3).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (1, 2):

1. Move right to (1, 3)
2. Move down-right diagonally to (2, 3)

From these options, moving right to (1, 3) seems like a good first step as it keeps us on a path of empty spaces.

Let's make the move to (1, 3).

**Next move:** (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1

1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move right to (1, 4)
2. Move down-right diagonally to (2, 4)

Moving right to (1, 4) keeps us on a path of empty spaces and seems like a good choice to continue progressing towards the goal.

**Next move:** (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move right to (1, 5)
2. Move down-right diagonally to (2, 5)

Moving right to (1, 5) keeps us on a path of empty spaces and continues to bring us closer to the goal.

**Next move:** (1, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 5), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move right to (1, 6)
2. Move down-left diagonally to (2, 4)
3. Move down to (2, 5)

Moving down to (2, 5) keeps us on a path of empty spaces and continues to bring us closer to the goal.

**Next move:** (2, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 5), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move left to (2, 4)
2. Move down-left diagonally to (3, 4)

Moving down-left diagonally to (3, 4) keeps us on a path of empty spaces and brings us closer to the goal.

**Next move:** (3, 4)

1. Move down to (4, 4)
2. Move left to (3, 3)
3. Move down-left diagonally to (4, 3)

Moving down-left diagonally to (4, 3) will take us directly to the goal position.

**Next move:** (4, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape: "L-shape"**

The empty spaces in the original maze form an "L-shape" path from the starting position (P) to the goal (G).

2. **New Maze with the Same "L-shape" Path:**

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming an "L-shape" path:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
```

In this new maze, the path from P to G still forms an "L-shape," but the configuration of walls and empty spaces is different from the original maze.
