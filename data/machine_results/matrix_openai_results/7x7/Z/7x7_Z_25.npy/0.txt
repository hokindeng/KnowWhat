You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 G 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- The player 'P' is located at (6, 5).
- The goal 'G' is located at (0, 3).

We can move in any of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to reach the goal. Let's find a path step-by-step.

From the current position (6, 5), we can move to any adjacent empty space. Let's move towards the goal:

1. Move from (6, 5) to (5, 4).

This move is valid because (5, 4) is an empty space ('0') and is adjacent to the current position. Please update the maze with this move, and I will provide the next step.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze. The empty spaces in the original maze form a diagonal path from the bottom right to the top left, resembling a "diagonal line" or "zigzag" shape.

### (1) General Shape: Diagonal Line

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar diagonal line shape. The path from 'P' to 'G' is valid and follows the same general diagonal pattern:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

In this new maze, the path from 'P' to 'G' still follows a diagonal line, but the specific configuration of walls and empty spaces is different from the original maze.
