You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 G 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position 'P' to the goal 'G'. The player is currently at position (6, 5), and the goal is at position (0, 3). We can move to any adjacent empty space, including diagonals.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (6, 5):

- Up to (5, 5) is blocked by a wall.
- Down is out of bounds.
- Left to (6, 4) is an empty space.
- Right to (6, 6) is an empty space.
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-left to (5, 4) is blocked by a wall.
  - Up-right to (5, 6) is blocked by a wall.
  - Down-left is out of bounds.
  - Down-right is out of bounds.

From (6, 5), the possible moves are to (6, 4) or (6, 6). Let's move to (6, 4) as it seems to be a step towards the goal.

The next move is to (6, 4).

- Up to (5, 4) is blocked by a wall.
- Down is out of bounds.
- Left to (6, 3) is an empty space.
- Right to (6, 5) is an empty space (where we came from).
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-left to (5, 3) is blocked by a wall.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze. The empty spaces in the original maze form a diagonal path from the bottom left to the top right, resembling a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern.

### (1) Name of the General Shape:
The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "zigzag" pattern.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape:
Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" pattern. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

```
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 P G
```

In this new maze, the path from 'P' to 'G' follows a similar zigzag pattern, but the walls and empty spaces are arranged differently from the original maze.
