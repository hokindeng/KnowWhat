You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The player is currently at position (3, 4), and the goal is at position (5, 2). We can move to any adjacent empty space ('0').

Let's examine the possible moves from the current position (3, 4):

- Up to (2, 4): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Down to (4, 4): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Left to (3, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Right to (3, 5): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal up-left to (2, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal up-right to (2, 5): This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal down-left to (4, 3): This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal down-right to (4, 5): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.

The possible moves are to (2, 5) or (4, 3). Let's choose to move to (4, 3) as it seems to be closer to the goal.

The next move is to position (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is now at position (4, 3). Let's examine the possible moves from this position:

- Up to (3, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Down to (5, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Left to (4, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Right to (4, 4): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal up-left to (3, 2): This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal up-right to (3, 4): This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal down-left to (5, 2): This is the goal ('G'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal down-right to (5, 4): This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.

The best move is to go directly to the goal at position (5, 2).

The next move is to position (5, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path from 'P' to 'G' involves moving diagonally and horizontally in a zigzag manner.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 P 1
```

In this new maze, the path from 'P' to 'G' follows a zigzag pattern similar to the original maze. The player starts at (6, 5) and can reach the goal at (5, 2) by moving through the empty spaces.
