You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position 'P' to the goal 'G'. The player's current position is at (3, 3), and the goal is at (3, 5). We can move to any adjacent empty space, including diagonals.

Let's examine the possible moves from the current position (3, 3):

- Up: (2, 3) is a wall.
- Down: (4, 3) is a wall.
- Left: (3, 2) is a wall.
- Right: (3, 4) is an empty space.
- Diagonal Up-Left: (2, 2) is a wall.
- Diagonal Up-Right: (2, 4) is an empty space.
- Diagonal Down-Left: (4, 2) is a wall.
- Diagonal Down-Right: (4, 4) is a wall.

The viable moves are:
- Right to (3, 4)
- Diagonal Up-Right to (2, 4)

To move closer to the goal, let's move right to (3, 4).

The next move is to (3, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form an "L" shape. Starting from the player's position (P) at (3, 3), the path goes right to (3, 4) and then up to (2, 4), forming an "L" shape.

2. **New Maze with the Same "L" Shape:**

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming an "L" shape. The path from 'P' to 'G' is different from the original maze but maintains the "L" shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at (3, 3).
- The path goes up to (2, 3) and then right to (2, 4), forming an "L" shape.
- The goal is at (6, 5), reachable by moving down from (2, 4) to (6, 5) through the empty spaces.
