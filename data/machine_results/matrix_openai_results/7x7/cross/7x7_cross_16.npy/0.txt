You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player position 'P' at (4, 5) to the goal 'G' at (2, 5). We can move to any adjacent empty space ('0').

Here's the current maze layout with coordinates:

```
(0,0) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
(1,0) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
(2,0) 1 1 1 0 1 G 1
(3,0) 1 1 1 1 0 1 1
(4,0) 1 1 1 0 1 P 1
(5,0) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
(6,0) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The player 'P' is currently at (4, 5). From here, the possible moves are:

- Up to (3, 5) which is a wall '1'
- Down to (5, 5) which is a wall '1'
- Left to (4, 4) which is a wall '1'
- Right to (4, 6) which is a wall '1'
- Diagonally up-left to (3, 4) which is an empty space '0'
- Diagonally up-right to (3, 6) which is a wall '1'
- Diagonally down-left to (5, 4) which is a wall '1'
- Diagonally down-right to (5, 6) which is a wall '1'

The only valid move is diagonally up-left to (3, 4).

Let's move to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player 'P' is now at position (3, 4). From here, let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (2, 4) which is a wall '1'
- Down to (4, 4) which is a wall '1'
- Left to (3, 3) which is a wall '1'
- Right to (3, 5) which is a wall '1'
- Diagonally up-left to (2, 3) which is an empty space '0'
- Diagonally up-right to (2, 5) which is the goal 'G'
- Diagonally down-left to (4, 3) which is an empty space '0'
- Diagonally down-right to (4, 5) which is an empty space '0'

The optimal move is diagonally up-right to (2, 5), which is the goal 'G'.

Let's move to (2, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "Z" shape. The path starts at the bottom right, moves diagonally up-left, and then diagonally up-right to reach the goal.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze, the player 'P' starts at (4, 2) and the goal 'G' is at (2, 4). The path follows a "Z" shape, moving from (4, 2) to (3, 3), and then to (2, 4).
