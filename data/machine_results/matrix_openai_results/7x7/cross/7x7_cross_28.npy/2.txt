You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- 'P' is located at (4, 4).
- 'G' is located at (2, 2).

From the current position (4, 4), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are:

1. Up to (3, 4) - but it's a wall.
2. Down to (5, 4) - but it's a wall.
3. Left to (4, 3) - but it's a wall.
4. Right to (4, 5) - but it's a wall.
5. Diagonal up-left to (3, 3) - but it's a wall.
6. Diagonal up-right to (3, 5) - but it's a wall.
7. Diagonal down-left to (5, 3) - but it's a wall.
8. Diagonal down-right to (5, 5) - but it's a wall.

The only valid move is to the left to (4, 3), which is an empty space.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To solve this task, let's first analyze the original maze to determine the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors).

### Original Maze Analysis

The original maze is:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The empty spaces form an "L" shape:
- Starting from (4, 4) (P), moving left to (4, 3), then up to (3, 3), and finally left to (2, 2) (G).

### New Maze with the Same "L" Shape

Now, let's create a new maze of the same size, with the empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but not identical to the original maze:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 G 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

### Explanation

- The new maze is the same size as the original.
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape:
  - Starting from (5, 4) (P), moving left to (5, 3), then up to (4, 3), and finally up to (3, 4) and left to (2, 2) (G).
- The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but the general shape of the path is still an "L".
