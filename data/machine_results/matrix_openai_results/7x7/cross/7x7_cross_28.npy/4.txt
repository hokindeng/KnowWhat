You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- 'P' is located at (4, 4).
- 'G' is located at (2, 2).

We can move to any adjacent empty space ('0') in any direction, including diagonals. Let's find a path from 'P' to 'G':

1. From (4, 4), we can move diagonally up-left to (3, 3).

Let's make this move:

- Move from (4, 4) to (3, 3).

Please update the maze with this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Great! Now that the player is at position (3, 3), let's continue moving towards the goal 'G' at (2, 2).

From (3, 3), we can move diagonally up-left to (2, 2), which is the goal position.

Let's make this move:

- Move from (3, 3) to (2, 2).

This move will take us to the goal. Please update the maze with this move.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form an "L" shape. The path starts from the bottom right, moves left, and then turns upward.

2. **New Maze with the Same "L" Shape:**

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming an "L" shape. The path is different, but the general shape is maintained:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 P G 1
```

In this new maze:
- 'P' is at (6, 4).
- 'G' is at (6, 5).

The path from 'P' to 'G' follows the "L" shape, moving right and then up.
