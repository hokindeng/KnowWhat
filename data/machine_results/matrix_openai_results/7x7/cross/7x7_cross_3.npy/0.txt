You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (4, 2), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (6, 0).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (4, 2):

- Up: (3, 2) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Down: (5, 2) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Left: (4, 1) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Right: (4, 3) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Diagonal Up-Left: (3, 1) is an empty space ('0'), so we can move there.
- Diagonal Up-Right: (3, 3) is an empty space ('0'), so we can move there.
- Diagonal Down-Left: (5, 1) is an empty space ('0'), so we can move there.
- Diagonal Down-Right: (5, 3) is an empty space ('0'), so we can move there.

To make progress towards the goal, let's move to (5, 1), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

The next move is to coordinates (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current position of 'P' is now at coordinates (5, 1), and the goal 'G' is still at coordinates (6, 0).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (5, 1):

- Up: (4, 1) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Down: (6, 1) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Left: (5, 0) is an empty space ('0'), so we can move there.
- Right: (5, 2) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Diagonal Up-Left: (4, 0) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Diagonal Up-Right: (4, 2) is an empty space ('0'), but it moves us away from the goal.
- Diagonal Down-Left: (6, 0) is the goal ('G'), so we can move there.
- Diagonal Down-Right: (6, 2) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.

The best move is to go directly to the goal at (6, 0).

The next move is to coordinates (6, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "Z" shape. The path starts at the bottom left, moves diagonally up to the right, then shifts horizontally to the left, and finally moves diagonally down to the right.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a "Z" shape. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 G
```

In this new maze, the path starts at the bottom left, moves diagonally up to the right, then shifts horizontally to the left, and finally moves diagonally down to the right, maintaining the "Z" shape.
