You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The player can move to any adjacent empty space ('0') in the grid. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- 'P' is located at (0, 4).
- 'G' is located at (2, 4).

From the current position (0, 4), the player can move to the following adjacent positions:

1. Down to (1, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
2. Right to (0, 5) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
3. Left to (0, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
4. Up to (-1, 4) - This is out of bounds, so it's not a valid move.
5. Diagonally down-right to (1, 5) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
6. Diagonally down-left to (1, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
7. Diagonally up-right to (-1, 5) - This is out of bounds, so it's not a valid move.
8. Diagonally up-left to (-1, 3) - This is out of bounds, so it's not a valid move.

The only valid move is to (1, 5). Let's move there.

The next move is to (1, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 5), the player can move to the following adjacent positions:

1. Down to (2, 5) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
2. Right to (1, 6) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
3. Left to (1, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
4. Up to (0, 5) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not a valid move.
5. Diagonally down-right to (2, 6) - This is an empty space ('0'), so it's a valid move.
6. Diagonally down-left to (2, 4) - This is the goal ('G'), so it's a valid move and the optimal choice.
7. Diagonally up-right to (0, 6) - This is an empty space ('0'), but not optimal since we can reach the goal directly.
8. Diagonally up-left to (0, 4) - This is an empty space ('0'), but not optimal since we can reach the goal directly.

The optimal move is to (2, 4), which is the goal position 'G'.

The next move is to (2, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L" shape. The path starts at (0, 4), moves diagonally down-right to (1, 5), and then diagonally down-left to (2, 4).

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming an "L" shape. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 P G 1
```

In this new maze, the path starts at (6, 4) with 'P', moves right to (6, 5), and then up through the column to reach 'G' at (6, 5), maintaining the "L" shape.
