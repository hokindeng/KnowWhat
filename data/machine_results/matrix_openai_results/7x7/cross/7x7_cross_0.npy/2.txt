You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position (P) to the goal (G) by moving through empty spaces (0) and avoiding walls (1). The player's current position is at (1,1), and the goal is at (5,1).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (1,1):

1. Up to (0,1) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
2. Down to (2,1) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
3. Left to (1,0) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
4. Right to (1,2) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
5. Diagonal moves:
   - Up-Left to (0,0) - This is an empty space (0), but it doesn't help us move towards the goal.
   - Up-Right to (0,2) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
   - Down-Left to (2,0) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
   - Down-Right to (2,2) - This is an empty space (0), and it moves us closer to the goal.

The only viable move that progresses towards the goal is to move diagonally down-right to (2,2).

Therefore, the next move is to (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2,2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (1,2) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
2. Down to (3,2) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
3. Left to (2,1) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
4. Right to (2,3) - This is an empty space (0), and it moves us closer to the goal.
5. Diagonal moves:
   - Up-Left to (1,1) - This is an empty space (0), but it moves us away from the goal.
   - Up-Right to (1,3) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
   - Down-Left to (3,1) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
   - Down-Right to (3,3) - This is an empty space (0), and it moves us closer to the goal.

The best move is to go diagonally down-right to (3,3), as it progresses towards the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3,3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (2,3) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
2. Down to (4,3) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
3. Left to (3,2) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
4. Right to (3,4) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
5. Diagonal moves:
   - Up-Left to (2,2) - This is an empty space (0), but it moves us away from the goal.
   - Up-Right to (2,4) - This is an empty space (0), and it moves us closer to the goal.
   - Down-Left to (4,2) - This is an empty space (0), and it moves us closer to the goal.
   - Down-Right to (4,4) - This is an empty space (0), but it doesn't move us closer to the goal.

The best move is to go diagonally down-left to (4,2), as it progresses towards the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4,2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (3,2) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
2. Down to (5,2) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
3. Left to (4,1) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
4. Right to (4,3) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
5. Diagonal moves:
   - Up-Left to (3,1) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.
   - Up-Right to (3,3) - This is an empty space (0), but it moves us away from the goal.
   - Down-Left to (5,1) - This is the goal (G), so this is the best move.
   - Down-Right to (5,3) - This is a wall (1), so it's not possible.

The best move is to go diagonally down-left to (5,1), which is the goal position.

Therefore, the next move is to (5,1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves diagonally and horizontally, creating a zigzagging route from the start to the goal.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag shape. The maze includes a valid path from P to G:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze, the path from P to G follows a zigzag pattern, moving through the empty spaces (0) while avoiding walls (1).
