You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- 'P' is located at (2, 3).
- 'G' is located at (0, 5).

From the current position (2, 3), we can move to any adjacent empty space ('0'). The possible moves are:

1. Up to (1, 4)
2. Right to (2, 4)

Let's choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Moving right to (2, 4) seems like a good option because it keeps us on the same row and moves us closer to the column where 'G' is located.

So, the next move is to (2, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze. The empty spaces in the original maze form a diagonal line from the bottom right to the top left, resembling a "diagonal line" shape.

Now, let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7) with a similar diagonal line shape formed by the empty spaces. The new maze should have a valid path from 'P' to 'G' and should not be an identical copy of the original maze.

### New Maze:
```
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 G
```

In this new maze:
- 'P' is located at (5, 0).
- 'G' is located at (6, 6).

The empty spaces form a diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right, maintaining the "diagonal line" shape. The path from 'P' to 'G' is valid and follows the diagonal line of empty spaces.
