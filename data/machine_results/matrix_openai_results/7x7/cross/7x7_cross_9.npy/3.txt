You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position 'P' to the goal 'G'. The player is currently at position (3, 4). Let's examine the possible moves:

From (3, 4), the possible moves are:
- Up to (2, 4) which is a wall '1'
- Down to (4, 4) which is a wall '1'
- Left to (3, 3) which is a wall '1'
- Right to (3, 5) which is a wall '1'
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-left to (2, 3) which is '0'
  - Up-right to (2, 5) which is a wall '1'
  - Down-left to (4, 3) which is a wall '1'
  - Down-right to (4, 5) which is '0'

The only valid moves are to (2, 3) and (4, 5). Let's choose to move to (2, 3) as it seems to be a step towards the goal.

The next move is to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- Right to (2, 4) which is a wall '1'
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-left to (1, 2) which is '0'
  - Up-right to (1, 4) which is '0'
  - Down-left to (3, 2) which is '0'
  - Down-right to (3, 4) which is '0'

The valid moves are to (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), and (3, 4). Let's move to (1, 2) as it seems to be a step towards the goal.

The next move is to (1, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze. The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern, moving diagonally from one side to the other.

Now, let's create a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The new maze will have a valid path from 'P' to 'G' and will not be an identical copy of the original maze.

### New Maze:
```
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
```

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar "zigzag" pattern, and there is a valid path from 'P' at (6, 5) to 'G' at (5, 6).
