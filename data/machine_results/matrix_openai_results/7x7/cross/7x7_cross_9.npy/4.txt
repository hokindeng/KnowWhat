You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position 'P' to the goal 'G'. The player is currently at position (3, 4), and the goal is at position (0, 5). We can move to any adjacent empty space ('0').

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (3, 4):

- Up to (2, 4): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Down to (4, 4): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Left to (3, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Right to (3, 5): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal up-left to (2, 3): This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal up-right to (2, 5): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal down-left to (4, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal down-right to (4, 5): This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.

From the above analysis, we have two possible moves: (2, 3) and (4, 5). Let's choose the move that seems to bring us closer to the goal. Moving to (2, 3) seems like a good step towards the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to position (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is now at position (2, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves from this position:

- Up to (1, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Down to (3, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Left to (2, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Right to (2, 4): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal up-left to (1, 2): This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal up-right to (1, 4): This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal down-left to (3, 2): This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal down-right to (3, 4): This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.

From the above analysis, we have four possible moves: (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), and (3, 4). To get closer to the goal at (0, 5), moving to (1, 4) seems like a good choice.

Therefore, the next move is to position (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is now at position (1, 4). Let's evaluate the possible moves from this position:

- Up to (0, 4): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Down to (2, 4): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Left to (1, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Right to (1, 5): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal up-left to (0, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal up-right to (0, 5): This is the goal ('G'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal down-left to (2, 3): This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal down-right to (2, 5): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.

From the above analysis, we can move to the goal at (0, 5).

Therefore, the next move is to position (0, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To solve this task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze. The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern, moving diagonally from the bottom left to the top right.

### (1) Name of the General Shape:
The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape:
Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7) with a similar zigzag pattern of empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from 'P' to 'G' and will not be an identical copy of the original maze.

```
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 G
```

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar zigzag pattern, and there is a valid path from 'P' at (5, 0) to 'G' at (6, 6).
