You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- 'P' is located at (3, 4).
- 'G' is located at (0, 5).

We can move to any adjacent empty space ('0'), including diagonals. Let's find a path from 'P' to 'G'.

Starting from (3, 4), the possible moves are:
- Up to (2, 4) (blocked by '1')
- Down to (4, 4) (blocked by '1')
- Left to (3, 3) (blocked by '1')
- Right to (3, 5) (blocked by '1')
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-Left to (2, 3) (open)
  - Up-Right to (2, 5) (blocked by '1')
  - Down-Left to (4, 3) (blocked by '1')
  - Down-Right to (4, 5) (open)

The only open moves are to (2, 3) and (4, 5). Let's choose (2, 3) as it seems to lead closer to the goal.

Move to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (1, 3) (blocked by '1')
- Down to (3, 3) (blocked by '1')
- Left to (2, 2) (open)
- Right to (2, 4) (blocked by '1')
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-Left to (1, 2) (open)
  - Up-Right to (1, 4) (open)
  - Down-Left to (3, 2) (open)
  - Down-Right to (3, 4) (blocked by '1')

The open moves are to (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 4), and (3, 2). Let's choose (1, 4) as it brings us closer to the goal.

Move to (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (0, 4) (blocked by '1')
- Down to (2, 4) (blocked by '1')
- Left to (1, 3) (blocked by '1')
- Right to (1, 5) (blocked by '1')
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-Left to (0, 3) (blocked by '1')
  - Up-Right to (0, 5) (goal 'G')
  - Down-Left to (2, 3) (open)
  - Down-Right to (2, 5) (blocked by '1')

The move to (0, 5) is directly to the goal 'G'. Let's move to (0, 5).

Move to (0, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves diagonally and horizontally, creating a zigzag-like shape through the grid.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" shape. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
```

In this new maze:
- 'P' is at (1, 1).
- 'G' is at (6, 5).

The path from 'P' to 'G' follows a zigzag pattern through the empty spaces.
