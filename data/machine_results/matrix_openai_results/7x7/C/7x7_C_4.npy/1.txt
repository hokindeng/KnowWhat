You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- 'P' is located at (2, 1).
- 'G' is located at (0, 4).

We can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent empty space ('0'). Let's find a path to the goal:

1. From (2, 1), move up to (1, 1).

Let's make this move:

Next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 4). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

- From (1, 1), we can move right to (1, 2), but it's a wall.
- We can move left to (1, 0), but it's a wall.
- We can move down to (2, 1), but that's where we came from.
- We can move up to (0, 1), which is an empty space.

Let's move up to (0, 1).

Next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 P 0 0 G 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 4). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

- From (0, 1), we can move right to (0, 2), which is an empty space.
- We cannot move left, as it would take us to a wall at (0, 0).
- We cannot move down, as it would take us back to (1, 1).
- We cannot move up, as it is out of bounds.

Let's move right to (0, 2).

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 P 0 G 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 4). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

- From (0, 2), we can move right to (0, 3), which is an empty space.
- We cannot move left, as it would take us back to (0, 1).
- We cannot move down, as it would take us to a wall at (1, 2).
- We cannot move up, as it is out of bounds.

Let's move right to (0, 3).

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 P G 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), we are very close to the goal at (0, 4). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

- From (0, 3), we can move right to (0, 4), which is the goal position 'G'.

Let's move right to (0, 4) to reach the goal.

Next move: (0, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "U" shape. The path starts at the bottom of the "U" and goes up, then across the top.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a "U" shape. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

```
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze, the path starts at 'P' at (4, 1), goes up to (0, 3), and then moves right to reach 'G' at (4, 5), maintaining the "U" shape.
