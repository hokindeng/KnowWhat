You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 P 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- 'P' is at (0, 1)
- 'G' is at (4, 3)

We can move in the directions: up, down, left, or right, but only through empty spaces ('0').

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. From (0, 1), move down to (1, 1) is not possible because it's a wall.
2. From (0, 1), move right to (0, 2).

Let's make the first move:

Move to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal 'G' at (4, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move left to (0, 1) - this is backtracking.
2. Move right to (0, 3) - this is an empty space and moves us closer to the goal.
3. Move down to (1, 2) - this is a wall.
4. Move up is not possible as we are at the top row.

The best move is to move right to (0, 3).

Move to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move left to (0, 2) - this is backtracking.
2. Move right to (0, 4) - this is a wall.
3. Move down to (1, 3) - this is a wall.
4. Move up is not possible as we are at the top row.

Since moving right and down are blocked by walls, the only viable move is to backtrack slightly to explore other paths. Therefore, move left to (0, 2).

Move to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the oversight. Let's reassess the situation from the current position (0, 2):

1. Move left to (0, 1) - this is backtracking.
2. Move right to (0, 3) - this is an empty space.
3. Move down to (1, 2) - this is a wall.
4. Move up is not possible as we are at the top row.

Since moving right to (0, 3) was previously explored and led to a dead end, let's try a different approach by moving down from the initial position (0, 1) to explore the path towards the goal.

From (0, 2), move left to (0, 1), then move down to (1, 0).

Move to (1, 0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task:

1. **Name of the General Shape:**
   The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles an "L" or a "hook" shape. The path starts at the top left and moves downwards, then turns right towards the goal.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**
   Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "L" shape. The path from 'P' to 'G' is valid and follows the same general shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze, the path starts at the leftmost position of the second row, moves right, and then turns downwards, maintaining the "L" shape.
