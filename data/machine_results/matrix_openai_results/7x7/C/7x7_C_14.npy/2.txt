You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 P 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- 'P' is at (0, 1)
- 'G' is at (4, 3)

We can move in the directions of up, down, left, or right, but only through empty spaces ('0'). Let's find a path to 'G'.

Starting from (0, 1), the possible moves are:
- Down to (1, 1), but it's a wall ('1')
- Right to (0, 2), which is an empty space ('0')

Let's move right to (0, 2).

The next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), the possible moves are:

- Down to (1, 2), but it's a wall ('1')
- Left to (0, 1), which is an empty space ('0')
- Right to (0, 3), which is an empty space ('0')

Let's move right to (0, 3).

The next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1 1 1

0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), the possible moves are:

- Down to (1, 3), but it's a wall ('1')
- Left to (0, 2), which is an empty space ('0')

Since moving right or down is not possible, let's backtrack and move left to (0, 2).

The next move is to (0, 2).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's reassess the situation. From the current position (0, 2), the possible moves are:

- Down to (1, 2), but it's a wall ('1')
- Left to (0, 1), which is an empty space ('0')
- Right to (0, 3), which is an empty space ('0')

Since moving right to (0, 3) didn't help us progress, let's try a different approach. We should move downwards to reach the goal. Let's move left to (0, 1) and then down to explore further.

The next move is to (0, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze. The empty spaces form a shape that resembles an "L" or a "hook" pattern, where the path goes down and then turns right.

### (1) General Shape: "L" Shape

### (2) New Maze with the Same "L" Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming an "L" shape. This maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze, the path starts at 'P' and follows the empty spaces in an "L" shape to reach 'G'.
