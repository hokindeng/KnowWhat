You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

P 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- 'P' is at (0, 0)
- 'G' is at (4, 3)

We can move in the directions of up, down, left, or right, but only through empty spaces ('0'). Let's find a path step-by-step.

From (0, 0), the possible moves are:
- Right to (0, 1)
- Down to (1, 0)

Let's move right to (0, 1).

The next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), the possible moves are:
- Right to (0, 2)
- Left to (0, 0)
- Down to (1, 1) (but this is a wall, so it's not possible)

Let's move right to (0, 2).

The next move is to (0, 2).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 4), the possible moves are:
- Left to (0, 3)
- Down to (1, 4) (but this is a wall, so it's not possible)

Since moving down is not possible, let's backtrack and move left to (0, 3).

The next move is to (0, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape resembling the letter "L". The path starts at the top left, moves horizontally to the right, then vertically down, and finally horizontally to the right again to reach the goal.

2. **New Maze with the Same "L" Shape:**

```
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 G
```

**Explanation:**
- The new maze is the same size as the original (7x7).
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze.
- The path starts at 'P', moves right, then down, and finally right again to reach 'G'.
- The maze is not an identical copy of the original.
