You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position 'P' to the goal 'G'. The player's current position is at (1, 2), and the goal is at (4, 3). We can move to adjacent empty spaces ('0') in the up, down, left, or right direction.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (1, 2):

1. Up to (0, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
2. Down to (2, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
3. Left to (1, 1) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
4. Right to (1, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.

To progress towards the goal, let's move right to (1, 3).

The next move is to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (0, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
2. Down to (2, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
3. Left to (1, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), but it takes us back to the previous position.
4. Right to (1, 4) - This is an empty space ('0'), and it moves us closer to the goal.

Let's move right to (1, 4).

The next move is to (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (0, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
2. Down to (2, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
3. Left to (1, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), but it takes us back to the previous position.
4. Right to (1, 5) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.

Since moving right or down is not possible, let's backtrack slightly and move left to (1, 3) to explore other paths.

The next move is to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves again:

1. Up to (0, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
2. Down to (2, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
3. Left to (1, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), but it takes us back to the previous position.
4. Right to (1, 4) - This is an empty space ('0'), but we have already explored this path.

Since the path to the right and backtracking to the left doesn't lead to progress, let's explore moving down from a different position. We should try moving down from (1, 1) to explore a new path.

Let's move left to (1, 2) to set up for a new path exploration.

The next move is to (1, 2).

3. Left to (1, 1) - This is an empty space ('0'), and it opens a new path to explore.
4. Right to (1, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), but it takes us back to the previous position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "U" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a "U" shape. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze, the player starts at (4, 1) and can reach the goal at (1, 3) by following the "U" shaped path of empty spaces.
