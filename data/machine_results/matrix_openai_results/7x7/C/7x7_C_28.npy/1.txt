You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Let's first identify the coordinates of 'P' and 'G':

- 'P' is located at (4, 3).
- 'G' is located at (1, 1).

We can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent empty space ('0'). Let's find a path from 'P' to 'G'.

Starting from (4, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 3) - blocked by a wall ('1').
- Down to (5, 3) - blocked by a wall ('1').
- Left to (4, 2) - open space ('0').
- Right to (4, 4) - blocked by a wall ('1').

The only valid move is to the left, to (4, 2).

Let's make the move to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 2) - blocked by a wall ('1').
- Down to (5, 2) - blocked by a wall ('1').
- Left to (4, 1) - open space ('0').
- Right to (4, 3) - open space ('0').

We can move left to (4, 1) or right to (4, 3). To progress towards the goal, let's move left to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 1) - open space ('0').
- Down to (5, 1) - blocked by a wall ('1').
- Left to (4, 0) - blocked by a wall ('1').
- Right to (4, 2) - open space ('0').

To continue towards the goal, let's move up to (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (2, 1) - open space ('0').
- Down to (4, 1) - open space ('0').
- Left to (3, 0) - blocked by a wall ('1').
- Right to (3, 2) - blocked by a wall ('1').

To continue towards the goal, let's move up to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (1, 1) - goal position ('G').
- Down to (3, 1) - open space ('0').
- Left to (2, 0) - blocked by a wall ('1').
- Right to (2, 2) - blocked by a wall ('1').

We can move up to (1, 1) to reach the goal. Let's move to (1, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles an "L" shape. The path starts from the bottom and moves upwards, then turns left towards the goal.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming an "L" shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 G
```

In this new maze:
- The player 'P' starts at (4, 1).
- The goal 'G' is at (6, 6).
- The path forms an "L" shape, starting from the bottom, moving upwards, and then turning right towards the goal.
