You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (3, 2), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (3, 5).

Let's examine the possible moves from the current position (3, 2):

1. Move right to (3, 3) - This is an empty space ('0').
2. Move diagonally right-down to (4, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
3. Move down to (4, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
4. Move diagonally left-down to (4, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
5. Move left to (3, 1) - This is an empty space ('0').
6. Move diagonally left-up to (2, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
7. Move up to (2, 2) - This is an empty space ('0').
8. Move diagonally right-up to (2, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.

The best move to get closer to the goal is to move right to (3, 3).

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal 'G' at (3, 5):

1. Move right to (3, 4) - This is an empty space ('0').
2. Move diagonally right-down to (4, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
3. Move down to (4, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
4. Move diagonally left-down to (4, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
5. Move left to (3, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), but it takes us back to the previous position.
6. Move diagonally left-up to (2, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), but it takes us away from the goal.
7. Move up to (2, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
8. Move diagonally right-up to (2, 4) - This is an empty space ('0'), but it takes us away from the goal.

The best move to get closer to the goal is to move right to (3, 4).

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal 'G' at (3, 5):

1. Move right to (3, 5) - This is the goal position ('G').
2. Move diagonally right-down to (4, 5) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
3. Move down to (4, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
4. Move diagonally left-down to (4, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
5. Move left to (3, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), but it takes us back to the previous position.
6. Move diagonally left-up to (2, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.
7. Move up to (2, 4) - This is an empty space ('0'), but it takes us away from the goal.
8. Move diagonally right-up to (2, 5) - This is a wall ('1'), so it's not possible.

The best move is to move right to (3, 5), which is the goal position.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves in a zigzag manner from the starting position 'P' to the goal 'G'.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" shape. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G' and is not an identical copy of the original maze:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze, the player 'P' starts at (3, 2) and the goal 'G' is at (5, 6). The path follows a zigzag pattern through the empty spaces.
