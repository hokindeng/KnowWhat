You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position (P) to the goal (G). The player's current position is at (1, 4), and the goal is at (4, 2). We can move to any adjacent empty space, including diagonals.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (1, 4):

- Up: (0, 4) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Down: (2, 4) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Left: (1, 3) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Right: (1, 5) is an empty space ('0'), so we can move there.
- Diagonal Down-Left: (2, 3) is an empty space ('0'), so we can move there.
- Diagonal Down-Right: (2, 5) is an empty space ('0'), so we can move there.

From these options, moving to (2, 3) seems like a good choice because it brings us closer to the goal. Let's move to (2, 3).

The next move is to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up: (1, 3) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Down: (3, 3) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Left: (2, 2) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Right: (2, 4) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Diagonal Down-Left: (3, 2) is an empty space ('0'), so we can move there.
- Diagonal Down-Right: (3, 4) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.

The only viable move is to (3, 2). Let's move to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1 0 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up: (2, 2) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Down: (4, 2) is the goal ('G'), so we can move there.
- Left: (3, 1) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Right: (3, 3) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Diagonal Up-Left: (2, 1) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Diagonal Up-Right: (2, 3) is an empty space ('0'), but we just came from there.
- Diagonal Down-Left: (4, 1) is an empty space ('0'), so we can move there.
- Diagonal Down-Right: (4, 3) is an empty space ('0'), but moving directly to the goal is preferable.

The best move is to go directly to the goal at (4, 2). Let's move to (4, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves diagonally and horizontally, creating a zigzagging route from the start to the goal.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze, the path from 'P' to 'G' follows a zigzag pattern, moving diagonally and horizontally through the empty spaces.
