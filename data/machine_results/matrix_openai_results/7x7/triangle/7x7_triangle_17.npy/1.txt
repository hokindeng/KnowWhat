You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position (P) to the goal (G). The player's current position is at (1, 4), and the goal is at (4, 2). We can move to any adjacent empty space, including diagonals.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (1, 4):

1. **Up**: (0, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
2. **Down**: (2, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
3. **Left**: (1, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
4. **Right**: (1, 5) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
5. **Diagonal Up-Left**: (0, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
6. **Diagonal Up-Right**: (0, 5) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
7. **Diagonal Down-Left**: (2, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
8. **Diagonal Down-Right**: (2, 5) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.

From these options, moving to (2, 3) seems promising as it brings us closer to the goal. Let's move to (2, 3).

**Next move: (2, 3)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (1, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
2. **Down**: (3, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
3. **Left**: (2, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
4. **Right**: (2, 4) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
5. **Diagonal Up-Left**: (1, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
6. **Diagonal Up-Right**: (1, 4) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
7. **Diagonal Down-Left**: (3, 2) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
8. **Diagonal Down-Right**: (3, 4) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.

Moving to (3, 2) is a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal. Let's move to (3, 2).

**Next move: (3, 2)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1 0 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (2, 2) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
2. **Down**: (4, 2) - This is the goal ('G'), so we can move here.
3. **Left**: (3, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
4. **Right**: (3, 3) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
5. **Diagonal Up-Left**: (2, 1) - This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
6. **Diagonal Up-Right**: (2, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), but we have already been here.
7. **Diagonal Down-Left**: (4, 1) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
8. **Diagonal Down-Right**: (4, 3) - This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.

The best move is to go directly to the goal at (4, 2).

**Next move: (4, 2)**

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape**: The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "Z" or zigzag pattern.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape**:

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "Z" shape. The maze is encoded with '1' for walls, '0' for empty spaces, 'P' for the player position, and 'G' for the goal position:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 0 1
```

In this new maze, the player starts at the bottom left corner (6, 0) and the goal is at (4, 5). The path from 'P' to 'G' follows a similar "Z" pattern through the empty spaces.
