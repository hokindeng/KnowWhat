You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 G 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (2, 4), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (0, 1).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (2, 4):

- Up to (1, 4): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Down to (3, 4): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Left to (2, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Right to (2, 5): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal up-left to (1, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal up-right to (1, 5): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal down-left to (3, 3): This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal down-right to (3, 5): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.

The only valid move is to the empty space at (3, 3). Let's move there.

The next move is to coordinates (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 G 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (2, 3): This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
- Down to (4, 3): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Left to (3, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Right to (3, 4): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal up-left to (2, 2): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Diagonal up-right to (2, 4): This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal down-left to (4, 2): This is an empty space ('0'), so we can move here.
- Diagonal down-right to (4, 4): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.

We have three possible moves: (2, 3), (2, 4), and (4, 2). To make progress towards the goal, let's move to (2, 4), which is closer to the goal.

The next move is to coordinates (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 G 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. Let's reevaluate the current position (2, 4) and find a valid move:

From (2, 4), the possible moves are:

- Up to (1, 4): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.
- Down to (3, 4): This is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move here.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze. The path from 'P' to 'G' in the original maze can be described as a "zigzag" shape, as it involves moving diagonally and horizontally through the maze.

Now, let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7) with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces, but maintaining a recognizable "zigzag" shape for the path from 'P' to 'G'. Here's the new maze:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player starts at 'P' (1, 0).
- The goal is at 'G' (6, 5).
- The path from 'P' to 'G' follows a zigzag pattern through the empty spaces ('0'), similar to the original maze's path shape.
