You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (1, 4), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (5, 0). We can move to any adjacent empty space ('0').

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (1, 4):

1. Move left to (1, 3) - This is an empty space.
2. Move down to (2, 4) - This is a wall.
3. Move up to (0, 4) - This is a wall.
4. Move right to (1, 5) - This is a wall.
5. Move diagonally down-left to (2, 3) - This is an empty space.
6. Move diagonally down-right to (2, 5) - This is a wall.
7. Move diagonally up-left to (0, 3) - This is a wall.
8. Move diagonally up-right to (0, 5) - This is a wall.

The viable moves are:
- Move left to (1, 3)
- Move diagonally down-left to (2, 3)

To progress towards the goal, let's move diagonally down-left to (2, 3).

The next move is to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 P 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move left to (2, 2) - This is a wall.
2. Move right to (2, 4) - This is a wall.
3. Move up to (1, 3) - This is an empty space.
4. Move down to (3, 3) - This is a wall.
5. Move diagonally up-left to (1, 2) - This is an empty space.
6. Move diagonally up-right to (1, 4) - This is an empty space.
7. Move diagonally down-left to (3, 2) - This is an empty space.
8. Move diagonally down-right to (3, 4) - This is a wall.

The viable moves are:
- Move up to (1, 3)
- Move diagonally up-left to (1, 2)
- Move diagonally up-right to (1, 4)
- Move diagonally down-left to (3, 2)

To continue progressing towards the goal, let's move diagonally down-left to (3, 2).

The next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 P 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move left to (3, 1) - This is a wall.
2. Move right to (3, 3) - This is a wall.
3. Move up to (2, 2) - This is a wall.
4. Move down to (4, 2) - This is a wall.
5. Move diagonally up-left to (2, 1) - This is a wall.
6. Move diagonally up-right to (2, 3) - This is an empty space.
7. Move diagonally down-left to (4, 1) - This is an empty space.
8. Move diagonally down-right to (4, 3) - This is a wall.

The viable moves are:
- Move diagonally up-right to (2, 3)
- Move diagonally down-left to (4, 1)

To continue progressing towards the goal, let's move diagonally down-left to (4, 1).

The next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 P 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move left to (4, 0) - This is an empty space and also the goal 'G'.
2. Move right to (4, 2) - This is a wall.
3. Move up to (3, 1) - This is a wall.
4. Move down to (5, 1) - This is a wall.
5. Move diagonally up-left to (3, 0) - This is an empty space.
6. Move diagonally up-right to (3, 2) - This is an empty space.
7. Move diagonally down-left to (5, 0) - This is the goal 'G'.
8. Move diagonally down-right to (5, 2) - This is a wall.

The viable moves are:
- Move left to (4, 0) (goal)
- Move diagonally down-left to (5, 0) (goal)

Since both (4, 0) and (5, 0) are the goal positions, let's move left to (4, 0).

The next move is to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
P 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems there was a misunderstanding in the previous move. The goal 'G' is actually at position (5, 0), not (4, 0). Let's correct that and move towards the goal.

From the current position (4, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move left to (4, -1) - This is out of bounds.
2. Move right to (4, 1) - This is an empty space.
3. Move up to (3, 0) - This is an empty space.
4. Move down to (5, 0) - This is the goal 'G'.
5. Move diagonally up-left to (3, -1) - This is out of bounds.
6. Move diagonally up-right to (3, 1) - This is a wall.
7. Move diagonally down-left to (5, -1) - This is out of bounds.
8. Move diagonally down-right to (5, 1) - This is a wall.

The viable move to reach the goal is:
- Move down to (5, 0) (goal)

Let's move down to (5, 0) to reach the goal.

The next move is to (5, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze. The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern, moving diagonally downwards from the top left to the bottom left.

### (1) Name of the General Shape:
The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape:
Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The player 'P' starts at (1, 0).
- The goal 'G' is at (5, 6).
- The empty spaces form a zigzag pattern similar to the original maze, providing a path from 'P' to 'G'.
