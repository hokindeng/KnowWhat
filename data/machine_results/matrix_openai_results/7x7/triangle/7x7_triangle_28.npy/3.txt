You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (2, 1), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (2, 3).

Let's examine the possible moves from the current position (2, 1):

1. Up to (1, 1) - This is an empty space ('0').
2. Down to (3, 1) - This is an empty space ('0').
3. Right to (2, 2) - This is a wall ('1').
4. Left to (2, 0) - This is a wall ('1').
5. Diagonal moves:
   - Up-Right to (1, 2) - This is an empty space ('0').
   - Up-Left to (1, 0) - This is a wall ('1').
   - Down-Right to (3, 2) - This is an empty space ('0').
   - Down-Left to (3, 0) - This is a wall ('1').

The goal is to reach (2, 3), so we should move towards it. The best move from (2, 1) is to go diagonally up-right to (1, 2), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current position of 'P' is now at coordinates (1, 2), and the goal 'G' is still at coordinates (2, 3).

Let's examine the possible moves from the current position (1, 2):

1. Up to (0, 2) - This is a wall ('1').
2. Down to (2, 2) - This is a wall ('1').
3. Right to (1, 3) - This is a wall ('1').
4. Left to (1, 1) - This is an empty space ('0').
5. Diagonal moves:
   - Up-Right to (0, 3) - This is a wall ('1').
   - Up-Left to (0, 1) - This is an empty space ('0').
   - Down-Right to (2, 3) - This is the goal ('G').
   - Down-Left to (2, 1) - This is an empty space ('0').

The goal is directly reachable from the current position by moving diagonally down-right to (2, 3).

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape**: The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves in a zigzag manner from the starting point to the goal.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape**:

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" pattern:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze, the path from 'P' to 'G' follows a zigzag pattern similar to the original maze, but the layout and positions of walls and empty spaces have been altered to create a different configuration.
