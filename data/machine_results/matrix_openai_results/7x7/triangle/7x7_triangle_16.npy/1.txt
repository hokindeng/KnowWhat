You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (4, 3), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (6, 3).

Let's examine the possible moves from the current position (4, 3):

1. Move up to (3, 3) - This is an empty space '0'.
2. Move down to (5, 3) - This is an empty space '0'.
3. Move left to (4, 2) - This is a wall '1'.
4. Move right to (4, 4) - This is an empty space '0'.
5. Move diagonally up-left to (3, 2) - This is a wall '1'.
6. Move diagonally up-right to (3, 4) - This is a wall '1'.
7. Move diagonally down-left to (5, 2) - This is a wall '1'.
8. Move diagonally down-right to (5, 4) - This is a wall '1'.

The viable moves are to (3, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 4). To get closer to the goal, moving down to (5, 3) is a good choice.

Therefore, the next move is to coordinates (5, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 3), let's examine the possible moves:

1. Move up to (4, 3) - This is an empty space '0'.
2. Move down to (6, 3) - This is the goal 'G'.
3. Move left to (5, 2) - This is a wall '1'.
4. Move right to (5, 4) - This is a wall '1'.
5. Move diagonally up-left to (4, 2) - This is a wall '1'.
6. Move diagonally up-right to (4, 4) - This is an empty space '0'.
7. Move diagonally down-left to (6, 2) - This is a wall '1'.
8. Move diagonally down-right to (6, 4) - This is an empty space '0'.

The best move is to move down to (6, 3), which is the goal 'G'.

Therefore, the next move is to coordinates (6, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape**: The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "Z" shape. The path starts at the top of the "Z" and moves diagonally down to the bottom.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape**:

Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7) with a "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces:

```
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
```

In this new maze, the player 'P' starts at (0, 3) and the goal 'G' is at (6, 6). The path follows a "Z" shape from the top to the bottom.
