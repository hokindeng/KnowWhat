You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position (P) to the goal (G) by moving through empty spaces (0). The player's current position is at (2, 5), and the goal is at (5, 5).

Let's examine the possible moves from the current position (2, 5):

- Up: (1, 5) - This is a wall (1).
- Down: (3, 5) - This is an empty space (0).
- Left: (2, 4) - This is a wall (1).
- Right: (2, 6) - This is a wall (1).
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-Left: (1, 4) - This is a wall (1).
  - Up-Right: (1, 6) - This is a wall (1).
  - Down-Left: (3, 4) - This is an empty space (0).
  - Down-Right: (3, 6) - This is a wall (1).

The viable moves are:
- Down to (3, 5)
- Diagonal Down-Left to (3, 4)

Let's move to (3, 5) as it is directly below the current position and leads towards the goal.

The next move is to (3, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 P 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 5), let's examine the possible moves:

- Up: (2, 5) - This is an empty space (0).
- Down: (4, 5) - This is an empty space (0).
- Left: (3, 4) - This is an empty space (0).
- Right: (3, 6) - This is a wall (1).
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-Left: (2, 4) - This is a wall (1).
  - Up-Right: (2, 6) - This is a wall (1).
  - Down-Left: (4, 4) - This is a wall (1).
  - Down-Right: (4, 6) - This is a wall (1).

The viable moves are:
- Up to (2, 5)
- Down to (4, 5)
- Left to (3, 4)

To continue towards the goal, let's move down to (4, 5).

The next move is to (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 P 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 5), let's examine the possible moves:

- Up: (3, 5) - This is an empty space (0).
- Down: (5, 5) - This is the goal (G).
- Left: (4, 4) - This is a wall (1).
- Right: (4, 6) - This is a wall (1).
- Diagonal moves:
  - Up-Left: (3, 4) - This is an empty space (0).
  - Up-Right: (3, 6) - This is a wall (1).
  - Down-Left: (5, 4) - This is an empty space (0).
  - Down-Right: (5, 6) - This is a wall (1).

The viable moves are:
- Up to (3, 5)
- Down to (5, 5) (goal)
- Diagonal Up-Left to (3, 4)
- Diagonal Down-Left to (5, 4)

Since moving down to (5, 5) will reach the goal, let's move there.

The next move is to (5, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves diagonally and vertically, creating a zigzagging route from the player position (P) to the goal (G).

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" shape. The maze is encoded using the same format as the original:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze, the path from P to G still follows a zigzag pattern, but the layout of walls and empty spaces is different from the original maze.
