You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
0 G 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position 'P' to the goal 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (3, 3). Let's examine the possible moves:

From (3, 3), the possible moves are:
- Right to (3, 4), but it's a wall '1'.
- Down to (4, 3), but it's a wall '1'.
- Left to (3, 2), but it's a wall '1'.
- Up to (2, 3), but it's a wall '1'.
- Diagonally down-right to (4, 4), but it's a wall '1'.
- Diagonally down-left to (4, 2), which is an empty space '0'.
- Diagonally up-right to (2, 4), which is an empty space '0'.
- Diagonally up-left to (2, 2), but it's a wall '1'.

The viable moves are to (4, 2) or (2, 4). Let's move to (2, 4) as it seems to be closer to the goal.

The next move is to (2, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape**: The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves diagonally and horizontally, creating a zigzagging corridor from the start to the goal.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape**:

Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7) with a zigzag pattern of empty spaces. The maze includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G' and is not an identical copy of the original maze:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
P 0 0 0 0 G 1
```

In this new maze, the path from 'P' to 'G' follows a zigzag pattern similar to the original maze, but the layout of walls and empty spaces is different.
