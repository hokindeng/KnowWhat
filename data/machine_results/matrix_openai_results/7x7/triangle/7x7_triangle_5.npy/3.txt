You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
0 G 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position 'P' to the goal 'G'. The current position of 'P' is at coordinates (3, 3). We can move to any adjacent empty space ('0').

Let's examine the possible moves from the current position (3, 3):

- Up: (2, 3) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Down: (4, 3) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Left: (3, 2) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Right: (3, 4) is an empty space ('0'), so we can move there.
- Diagonal Up-Left: (2, 2) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.
- Diagonal Up-Right: (2, 4) is an empty space ('0'), so we can move there.
- Diagonal Down-Left: (4, 2) is an empty space ('0'), so we can move there.
- Diagonal Down-Right: (4, 4) is a wall ('1'), so we cannot move there.

From these options, let's move to (2, 4), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

The next move is to coordinates (2, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first analyze the original maze to determine the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors).

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

Upon examining the original maze, the empty spaces form a path that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The path moves diagonally downwards and to the right, then shifts direction to the left, and finally moves downwards again towards the goal.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Now, let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7) with a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern for the empty spaces. The maze will have a valid path from 'P' to 'G' and will not be an identical copy of the original maze.

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
P 0 0 0 0 G 1
```

### Explanation

- The new maze maintains the "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern by having the path start from the bottom left, move diagonally upwards and to the right, then shift direction to the left, and finally move rightwards again towards the goal.
- The path is different from the original maze but retains the recognizable pattern.
- The player 'P' starts at (6, 0) and the goal 'G' is at (6, 5), with a clear path through the empty spaces ('0').
