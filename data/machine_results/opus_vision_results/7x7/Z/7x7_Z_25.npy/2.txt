# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in five directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or DIAGONAL
2. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
3. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
4. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE cell): (6,5)
- The goal (RED cell): (0,3)
- Dark grey cells are the paths I can move through

From my current position at (6,5), I can move to adjacent cells that are dark grey. Looking at my options:
- Left to (6,4) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- Right to (6,6) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- Up to (5,5) - This is a white cell (wall - cannot move here)
- The diagonal cells around me are either white (walls) or out of bounds

Since I need to reach (0,3) which is up and to the left, I'll move left to get closer to the goal.

Next move: (6,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (6,4). Looking at my adjacent cells:
- Up to (5,4) - This is a white cell (wall - cannot move)
- Left to (6,3) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- Right to (6,5) - This is a dark grey cell (where I came from)

Since I need to reach (0,3) and I'm currently in column 4, moving left to column 3 will align me with the goal's column. This is a good strategic move.

Next move: (6,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (6,3), which is in the same column as the goal at (0,3). Looking at my adjacent cells:
- Up to (5,3) - This is a white cell (wall - cannot move)
- Left to (6,2) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- Right to (6,4) - This is a dark grey cell (where I came from)

Since I cannot move directly up due to the wall, I need to find an alternate path. I'll move left to explore other routes.

Next move: (6,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (6,2). Looking at my adjacent cells:
- Up to (5,2) - This is a white cell (wall - cannot move)
- Left to (6,1) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- Right to (6,3) - This is a dark grey cell (where I came from)

Since I still cannot move directly up, I'll continue moving left to find an alternate path.

Next move: (6,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (6,1). Looking at my adjacent cells:
- Up to (5,1) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- Left to (6,0) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)  
- Right to (6,2) - This is a dark grey cell (where I came from)

Since I need to move upward to reach the goal at (0,3), I'll move up.

Next move: (5,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (5,1). Looking at my adjacent cells, including diagonal moves:
- Up to (4,1) - This is a white cell (wall - cannot move)
- Right to (5,2) - This is a white cell (wall - cannot move)
- Down to (6,1) - This is a dark grey cell (where I came from)
- Diagonal up-right to (4,2) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)

Since I can move diagonally and (4,2) is a dark grey cell that moves me upward toward the goal, I'll take that diagonal move.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (4,2). Looking at my adjacent cells, including diagonal moves:
- Up to (3,2) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- Right to (4,3) - This is a white cell (wall - cannot move)
- Diagonal up-right to (3,3) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)

Since the goal is at (0,3), moving diagonally to (3,3) will put me in the same column as the goal and move me closer. This is the most direct path.

Next move: (3,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (3,3), in the same column as the goal at (0,3). Looking at my adjacent cells:
- Up to (2,3) - This is a white cell (wall - cannot move)
- Right to (3,4) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- Left to (3,2) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- Diagonal up-right to (2,4) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)

Since I can't move directly up due to the wall, I'll move diagonally up-right to (2,4) to get closer to the goal row.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (2,4). Looking at all adjacent cells including diagonals:
- Up to (1,4) - This is a white cell (wall - cannot move)
- Right to (2,5) - This is a white cell (wall - cannot move)
- Left to (2,3) - This is a white cell (wall - cannot move)
- Down to (3,4) - This is a white cell (wall - cannot move)
- Diagonal up-right to (1,5) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- Diagonal down-left to (3,3) - This is a dark grey cell (where I came from)

I'll move diagonally up-right to (1,5) to continue making progress upward.

Next move: (1,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (1,5). Looking at all adjacent cells including diagonals:
- Up to (0,5) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- Left to (1,4) - This is a white cell (wall - cannot move)
- Right to (1,6) - This is a white cell (wall - cannot move)
- Down to (2,5) - This is a white cell (wall - cannot move)
- Diagonal up-left to (0,4) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- Diagonal up-right to (0,6) - This is a dark grey cell (valid move)

Since the goal is at (0,3), I'll move diagonally up-left to (0,4) to get to row 0 and closer to the goal column.

Next move: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at position (0,4) and the goal is right next to me at (0,3). I can move directly left to reach the RED goal cell.

Next move: (0,3)

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "7" shape. This is evident from the way the non-wall cells create a horizontal line across the top row, then descend diagonally from right to left, forming a pattern that resembles the number 7. The path starts at the bottom, moves up the diagonal portion, and then across the top horizontal segment.

Part 2: Here is my new 7-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
0 0 0 G 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 S 1 1 1 1 1
```

This maze maintains the "7" shape with:
- A horizontal corridor across the top row
- A diagonal corridor descending from right to left
- The start position (S) at the bottom
- The goal position (G) in the top row
- Valid path exists from S to G following the 7 shape
- Different specific layout from the original while maintaining the same general pattern

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
