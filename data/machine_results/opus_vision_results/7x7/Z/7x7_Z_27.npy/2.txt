# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in five directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or DIAGONAL
2. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
3. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
4. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- I'm currently at position (3,3) - the BLUE cell
- The goal is at position (6,4) - the RED cell
- I need to find a path through the DARK GREY cells

From my current position, I can see the following DARK GREY cells nearby:
- (3,4) to my right
- (3,5) further right
- (3,6) even further right

The cell directly to my right (3,4) is a valid move since it's a DARK GREY path cell.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position (3,4), I can see the goal at (6,4) below me. I need to find a path downward.

From here, I can see these adjacent cells:
- (3,5) to my right - DARK GREY (valid)
- (4,5) diagonally down-right - DARK GREY (valid)
- (4,4) directly below - WHITE (wall, blocked)

Since I need to move downward toward the goal and the cell directly below is blocked, I'll take the diagonal path.

Next move: (4,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at (4,5) and can see the goal at (6,4). Looking at my adjacent cells:

- (5,4) diagonally down-left - DARK GREY (valid)
- (5,5) directly below - WHITE (wall, blocked)
- (4,4) to my left - WHITE (wall, blocked)

The diagonal move to (5,4) is the best option as it gets me closer to the goal.

Next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm at (5,4) and the goal at (6,4) is directly below me. I can move straight down to reach it!

Next move: (6,4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "7" shape. This is evident from the horizontal corridor at the top (from 3,3 to 3,6) and the vertical corridor down the right side (from 3,4 to 6,4), with a small branch at the bottom (6,3 to 6,5).

Part 2: Here is my new "7"-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 S 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 1
```

This maze maintains the "7" shape pattern but with some variations:
- The horizontal part of the "7" is at the same level but slightly different layout
- The vertical part still connects to the goal
- There's still a small branch at the bottom
- The start and goal positions are in different but logical positions
- There is at least one valid path from S to G
- The overall dimensions are preserved (7x7)

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
