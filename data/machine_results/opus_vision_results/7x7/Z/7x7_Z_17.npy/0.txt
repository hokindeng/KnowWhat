# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in five directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or DIAGONAL
2. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
3. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
4. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (1,2)
- The goal (RED): (4,3)
- Available paths (DARK GREY) that I can move through

From my current position at (1,2), I can move to adjacent dark grey cells. Looking at my immediate options:
- LEFT to (1,1) - dark grey path
- RIGHT to (1,3) - dark grey path
- UP, DOWN, and diagonal moves lead to white walls

To reach the goal at (4,3), I'll need to navigate through the available paths. I can see a route going right along row 1, then finding a way down.

Next move: (1,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position (1,3), I need to find a path to reach the goal at (4,3). From here, I can see that:

- Moving directly down is blocked by white walls
- I can continue moving right along row 1 where there are dark grey paths
- I'll need to find a way to descend to row 4 eventually

From (1,3), I can move right to (1,4) which is a dark grey path.

Next move: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (1,4) and need to reach the goal at (4,3). Looking at my options:

- I can continue right to (1,5) which is a dark grey path
- Below me (2,4) is white, so I can't go directly down
- I need to find a way to descend to row 4

I'll continue moving right along the available path to find a way down.

Next move: (1,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (1,5) and need to reach the goal at (4,3). Looking at my adjacent cells:

- Right (1,6) is dark grey
- Down (2,5) is dark grey
- I need to descend to reach row 4

I'll move down to start making my way toward the goal.

Next move: (2,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (2,5) and need to reach the goal at (4,3). Looking at my options:

- Down (3,5) is white - blocked
- Left (2,4) is white - blocked 
- Right (2,6) is white - blocked
- I can move diagonally down-left to (3,4) which is dark grey

This diagonal move will get me closer to row 4 where the goal is located.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (3,4) and the goal is at (4,3), which is directly diagonally down-left from my current position. Since I can move diagonally and the goal is an adjacent cell, I can reach it in one move.

Next move: (4,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "7" shape. This is evident from the horizontal corridor along row 1 that extends from column 1 to 5, which then connects to a vertical segment at the rightmost position (column 5, row 2), followed by another horizontal segment that extends left at row 3-4 (through column 4 to 3).

Part 2: Here is my new "7"-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The horizontal top bar of the "7" runs along row 1
- The vertical segment is on the right side
- The bottom horizontal segment is shorter but maintains the "7" shape
- There is a valid path from S to G
- The layout is different from the original while maintaining the same basic "7" shape pattern
- The dimensions are identical (7x7)

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
