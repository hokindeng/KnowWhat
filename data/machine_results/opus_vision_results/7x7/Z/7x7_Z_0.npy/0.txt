# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in five directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or DIAGONAL
2. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
3. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
4. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- I'm currently at position (5,3) - the BLUE cell
- The goal is at position (0,2) - the RED cell
- I need to find a path through the DARK GREY cells

From my current position (5,3), I can see the adjacent cells. The available dark grey cells I can move to are:
- (5,2) - to my left
- (5,4) - to my right

Since the goal is at column 2, moving left to (5,2) would bring me closer to the target column.

Next move: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good! I'm now at position (5,2). Looking at my current position, I need to move upward to reach the goal at (0,2).

From (5,2), I can see the adjacent cells:
- (4,2) is WHITE - can't move there
- (5,1) is DARK GREY - can move there
- (4,1) is DARK GREY - can move there (diagonal)

Since I need to move up toward row 0, and (4,1) is a valid diagonal move that gets me closer to the goal, I'll take that path.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at position (4,1). I need to continue moving upward toward the goal at (0,2).

Looking at the adjacent cells from my current position (4,1):
- (3,1) is WHITE - can't move there
- (3,2) is DARK GREY - can move there (diagonal up-right)
- (4,2) is WHITE - can't move there
- (5,1) is DARK GREY - but that would move me down

The best move is to go diagonally up and right to (3,2), which gets me closer to both the target row and column.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm now at position (3,2). I'm in the same column as the goal at (0,2), but I need to move up 3 rows.

Looking at the adjacent cells from my current position (3,2):
- (2,2) is WHITE - can't move there
- (2,3) is DARK GREY - can move there (diagonal up-right)
- (3,3) is DARK GREY - can move there (right)

Since I can't move directly up, I need to go around the white cell at (2,2). I'll move diagonally to (2,3).

Next move: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Great! I'm now at position (2,3). The goal is at (0,2), so I need to continue moving upward.

Looking at the adjacent cells from my current position (2,3):
- (1,3) is WHITE - can't move there
- (1,2) is WHITE - can't move there  
- (1,4) is DARK GREY - can move there (diagonal up-right)
- (2,2) is WHITE - can't move there

To continue toward the goal, I'll move diagonally to (1,4), which gets me closer to row 0.

Next move: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at position (1,4) and just one row away from the goal at (0,2).

Looking at the adjacent cells from my current position (1,4):
- (0,3) is DARK GREY - can move there (diagonal up-left)
- (0,4) is DARK GREY - can move there (directly up)
- (0,5) is DARK GREY - can move there (diagonal up-right)

Since I need to reach (0,2), moving to (0,3) would put me adjacent to the goal. I'll move diagonally up-left.

Next move: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm now at position (0,3), right next to the goal! The RED cell at (0,2) is directly to my left.

Since I can move to adjacent cells, I'll move left to reach the goal.

Next move: (0,2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "Z" shape. This is evident from tracing all the non-wall (dark grey) cells, which create a diagonal line starting from the bottom left area, moving up and right through the middle, and then continuing to the top right area of the maze. The pattern resembles a tilted "Z" letter.

Part 2: Here is my new Z-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 0 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 S 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This maze:
- Maintains the Z-shape pattern of connected corridors
- Has different start/goal positions while keeping the Z pattern
- Provides a valid path from S to G
- Uses the same 7x7 dimensions as the original
- Creates a distinct layout while preserving the essential Z-shaped corridor pattern
- The path requires similar diagonal movements but in a different configuration

The Z-shape is still clearly visible when tracing the available corridors (0s, S, and G), but the specific implementation differs from the original maze while maintaining the same general pattern.
