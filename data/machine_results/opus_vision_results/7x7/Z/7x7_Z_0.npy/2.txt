# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in five directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or DIAGONAL
2. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
3. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
4. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- I'm currently at position (5,3) - the BLUE cell
- The goal is at position (0,2) - the RED cell
- I need to find a path through the DARK GREY cells

From my current position (5,3), let me check the adjacent cells:
- The cells around me that are DARK GREY (passable) are: (5,4) to my right

Since (5,4) is the only available move from my current position, I'll move there.

Next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I've moved to (5,4). Now let me check the adjacent cells from my current position:

From (5,4), I can see:
- (5,5) to my right is DARK GREY (passable)
- All other adjacent cells are WHITE (walls)

I'll move right to continue navigating the maze.

Next move: (5,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (5,5). Looking at the adjacent cells:
- (5,4) to my left is DARK GREY (where I came from)
- All other adjacent cells are WHITE (walls)

It seems I've reached a dead end. I need to backtrack to find another path to the goal. I'll move back to (5,4).

Next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (5,4). Looking around:
- (5,5) to my right leads to a dead end (just came from there)
- All other adjacent cells except (5,3) are WHITE walls

I need to continue backtracking to find another route. I'll move back to (5,3).

Next move: (5,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (5,3). Let me check my options more carefully. Looking at the adjacent cells:
- (5,2) to my left is DARK GREY (passable)
- (5,4) to my right is DARK GREY but leads to a dead end

I'll move left to explore a different path.

Next move: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm at (5,2). Looking at all adjacent cells including diagonals:
- (5,1) to my left is DARK GREY
- (4,1) diagonally up and left is DARK GREY

Since I can move diagonally, I'll move to (4,1) as it gets me closer to the goal at (0,2).

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent, I'm at (4,1). Looking at all adjacent cells including diagonals:
- (3,2) diagonally up and right is DARK GREY and moves me closer to the goal

I'll move diagonally up-right.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Great! I'm at (3,2). Looking at all adjacent cells including diagonals:
- (2,3) diagonally up and right is DARK GREY
- This moves me closer to row 0 where the goal is located

I'll move diagonally up-right.

Next move: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (2,3). Looking at all adjacent cells including diagonals:
- (1,4) diagonally up and right is DARK GREY (passable)
- This continues my path upward toward row 0 where the goal is

I'll move diagonally up-right.

Next move: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm at (1,4) and I can see the goal at (0,2) is very close. Looking at all adjacent cells including diagonals:
- (0,3) directly above me is DARK GREY (passable)
- (0,4) diagonally up-right is DARK GREY
- (0,5) to the upper-right is DARK GREY

I'll move up to (0,3) as it gets me to row 0 and closer to the goal.

Next move: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (0,3) and I can see the RED goal at (0,2) is directly to my left. I'll move left to reach the goal.

Next move: (0,2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "Z" shape. This is evident from following the non-wall (DARK GREY) cells from top to bottom - they start in the top row, then diagonal down to the right, and finally extend horizontally at the bottom, creating a classic "Z" pattern.

Part 2: Here is my new Z-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 S 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This maze:
- Maintains the Z-shape pattern of corridors
- Has different start/goal positions while keeping the same general shape
- Provides a valid path from S to G
- Uses the same 7x7 dimensions as the original
- Creates the Z-shape using a different specific arrangement of corridors

The path from S to G is possible by moving through the connected corridor cells, maintaining the Z-pattern but with a fresh layout compared to the original maze.
