# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in five directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or DIAGONAL
2. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
3. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
4. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- I'm currently at position (5,3) - the BLUE cell
- The goal is at position (0,2) - the RED cell
- I need to navigate through the DARK GREY paths to reach it

From my current position (5,3), I can see the adjacent cells:
- (5,2) to my left is a dark grey path - I can move there
- (5,4) to my right is a dark grey path - I can move there
- The cells above and below me are white walls

I'll start by moving left to explore that direction.

Next move: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I've moved to (5,2). Now I need to continue finding a path to reach the goal at (0,2).

From my current position (5,2), I can see:
- (5,1) to my left is a dark grey path - I can move there
- (5,3) to my right is where I came from
- (4,2) above me is a white wall - blocked
- (6,2) below me is a white wall - blocked

I'll continue moving left to explore that direction.

Next move: (5,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (5,1) and need to reach the goal at (0,2). Looking at my options:
- (5,0) to my left is a dark grey path
- (4,1) above me is a dark grey path - this would move me closer to the goal
- (6,1) below me is a white wall - blocked
- (5,2) to my right is where I came from

I'll move up to get closer to the goal.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,1) and need to reach the goal at (0,2). Looking at my adjacent cells:
- (4,0) to my left is a white wall - blocked
- (4,2) to my right is a white wall - blocked
- (3,1) above me is a white wall - blocked
- (5,1) below me is where I came from

Since I can also move diagonally, let me check those options:
- (3,2) is a dark grey path - I can move there!

I'll move diagonally up and right.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Great! I'm at (3,2) and getting closer to the goal at (0,2). Looking at my options:
- (3,1) to my left is a white wall - blocked
- (3,3) to my right is a dark grey path
- (2,2) above me is a white wall - blocked
- (4,2) below me is a white wall - blocked

Checking diagonal moves:
- (2,3) diagonally up-right is a dark grey path - this moves me closer to the goal!

I'll move diagonally up and right.

Next move: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (2,3) and the goal is at (0,2). Looking at my adjacent cells:
- (2,2) to my left is a white wall - blocked
- (2,4) to my right is a white wall - blocked
- (1,3) above me is a white wall - blocked
- (3,3) below me is a dark grey path

Checking diagonal moves:
- (1,4) diagonally up-right is a dark grey path - this moves me closer to the goal row!

I'll move diagonally up and right.

Next move: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm at (1,4) and the goal is at (0,2). I'm just one row away from the goal row. Looking at my options:
- (0,4) directly above me is a dark grey path - this gets me to the goal row!
- (1,3) to my left is a white wall - blocked
- (1,5) to my right is a white wall - blocked
- (2,4) below me is a white wall - blocked

I'll move up to reach the goal row.

Next move: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (0,4) on the same row as the goal at (0,2). I need to move left to reach it. Looking at my options:
- (0,3) to my left is a dark grey path - this moves me closer to the goal!
- (0,5) to my right would move me away from the goal
- (1,4) below me is where I came from

I'll move left toward the goal.

Next move: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm at (0,3) and the goal is right next to me at (0,2). I can see the RED goal cell is directly to my left. This will be my final move!

Next move: (0,2)

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "Z" shape. This is evident from following the pattern of non-wall (dark grey) cells from top to bottom: it starts horizontally across the top row (0,0 to 0,5), then diagonally down through (2,3) and (3,2), and finally horizontally again at the bottom (5,0 to 5,5), creating a clear "Z" pattern.

Part 2: Here is my new Z-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
0 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
S 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This maze:
- Maintains the Z-shape pattern of corridors
- Has different start (bottom left) and goal (top) positions
- Provides a valid path from start to goal
- Uses the same 7x7 dimensions as the original
- Creates a distinct layout while preserving the basic Z-shape pattern
- The path requires moving right along the bottom, diagonally up-left through the middle, and then right along the top to reach the goal
