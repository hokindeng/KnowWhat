# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in five directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or DIAGONAL
2. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
3. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
4. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (2,1)
- The goal (RED): (6,3)
- I need to find a path through the dark grey cells

From my current position (2,1), I can see the adjacent cells:
- UP (1,1): WHITE - wall, can't go
- DOWN (3,1): WHITE - wall, can't go  
- LEFT (2,0): WHITE - wall, can't go
- RIGHT (2,2): DARK GREY - path, can go!

The only valid move from my current position is to move right.

Next move: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position (2,2), I need to continue navigating toward the goal at (6,3).

Looking at the adjacent cells from (2,2):
- UP (1,2): WHITE - wall, blocked
- DOWN (3,2): WHITE - wall, blocked
- LEFT (2,1): DARK GREY - path, but that's where I came from
- RIGHT (2,3): DARK GREY - path, can move here!

Moving right will bring me closer to the goal column (3).

Next move: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position (2,3), I need to reach the goal at (6,3). I'm in the correct column but need to move down 4 rows.

Checking adjacent cells from (2,3):
- UP (1,3): WHITE - wall, blocked
- DOWN (3,3): WHITE - wall, blocked
- LEFT (2,2): DARK GREY - came from here
- RIGHT (2,4): DARK GREY - path available

Since I can't move directly down due to the wall at (3,3), I need to find an alternate route. I'll move right to continue exploring.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position (2,4), I need to find a way down to reach the goal at (6,3).

Looking at adjacent cells from (2,4):
- UP (1,4): WHITE - wall, blocked
- DOWN (3,4): DARK GREY - path, can move here!
- LEFT (2,3): DARK GREY - where I came from
- RIGHT (2,5): DARK GREY - path available

I'll move down to get closer to the goal row.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position (3,4), I need to find a way to continue toward the goal at (6,3).

Looking at adjacent cells from (3,4):
- UP (2,4): DARK GREY - where I came from
- DOWN (4,4): WHITE - wall, blocked
- LEFT (3,3): WHITE - wall, blocked  
- RIGHT (3,5): WHITE - wall, blocked
- DIAGONAL DOWN-LEFT (4,3): DARK GREY - path available!

Since the direct paths are blocked, I'll use the diagonal movement option to go down-left.

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position (4,3), I can see the goal is directly below me at (6,3)! I'm in the right column and just need to move down.

Looking at adjacent cells from (4,3):
- UP (3,3): WHITE - wall, blocked
- DOWN (5,3): DARK GREY - path, can move here!
- LEFT (4,2): WHITE - wall, blocked
- RIGHT (4,4): WHITE - wall, blocked

I'll move down to get closer to the goal.

Next move: (5,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "T" shape. This is evident from looking at all the dark grey, blue, and red cells together - they create a horizontal line across the top row (2,1 through 2,5) and a vertical line down the middle (from the top horizontal line down to 6,3), forming a clear "T" pattern.

Part 2: Here is my new T-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 S 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The T-shape is maintained with a horizontal corridor at row 2
- The vertical part of the T goes down the middle at column 3
- The start position 'S' is placed in the horizontal part of the T
- The goal 'G' is placed near the bottom of the vertical part
- The path from S to G is different from the original maze
- The overall dimensions remain 7x7
- The basic T-shape pattern is preserved while creating a different layout
