# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in five directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or DIAGONAL
2. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
3. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
4. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (5,1)
- Goal position (RED): (1,0)
- Available paths (DARK GREY cells)

From my current position at (5,1), I can move to adjacent cells that are dark grey. Let me check my options:
- UP to (4,1): This is a dark grey cell - valid move
- LEFT to (5,0): This is a dark grey cell - valid move
- Other directions lead to white cells (walls)

I'll move up to get closer to the goal.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm now at (4,1). Looking at my current position, I need to find a path to reach the goal at (1,0).

From (4,1), I can see the following adjacent cells:
- (3,2) diagonal up-right: Dark grey - valid move
- (5,0) diagonal down-left: Dark grey - valid move
- (5,1) down: Dark grey - valid (but that's where I came from)
- Other directions are white cells (walls)

To reach the goal at (1,0), I should move up and to the left. The path through (3,2) looks promising as it gets me closer to the goal.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,2) now. Looking at my adjacent cells:

From (3,2), I can see:
- (2,3) up-right: Dark grey - valid move
- (4,1) down-left: Dark grey - valid (but that's where I came from)
- All other adjacent cells are white (walls)

To continue toward the goal at (1,0), I'll move to (2,3) which gets me closer to row 1.

Next move: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (2,3) now. Looking at adjacent cells:

From (2,3), I can see:
- (1,3) up: Dark grey - valid move
- (1,4) diagonal up-right: Dark grey - valid move
- (3,2) diagonal down-left: Dark grey - valid (but that's where I came from)
- Other directions are white cells (walls)

To get closer to the goal at (1,0), I'll move up to (1,3), which puts me on the same row as the goal.

Next move: (1,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (1,3) now, on the same row as the goal at (1,0). 

From (1,3), I can see:
- (1,2) left: Dark grey - valid move
- (1,4) right: Dark grey - valid (but moves away from goal)
- (0,3) up: Dark grey - valid
- (2,3) down: Dark grey - valid (where I came from)

I'll move left to get closer to the goal.

Next move: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Great! I'm at (1,2) and getting closer to the goal at (1,0).

From (1,2), I can see:
- (1,1) left: Dark grey - valid move
- (1,3) right: Dark grey - valid (but that's where I came from)
- (0,2) up: Dark grey - valid
- Other adjacent cells are white (walls)

I'll continue moving left toward the goal.

Next move: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm at (1,1) and I can see the goal (RED cell) is right next to me at (1,0).

From (1,1), I can see:
- (1,0) left: RED cell - This is the GOAL!
- (0,1) up: Dark grey - valid
- (1,2) right: Dark grey - valid (but that's where I came from)
- Other adjacent cells are white (walls)

I'll move left to reach the goal!

Next move: (1,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "7" shape. This is evident from tracing all the non-wall (dark grey) cells, including the start and goal positions. The pattern shows a horizontal line across the top row (from column 0 to 4), then a vertical line descending from around column 3, with a small branch extending left in the middle. When viewed together, these corridors create a shape similar to the number "7".

Part 2: Here is my new "7"-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 S 1 1 1
1 1 G 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This new maze:
1. Maintains the 7x7 dimensions of the original
2. Preserves the "7" shape pattern with corridors
3. Has a valid path from start (S) to goal (G)
4. Uses a different layout than the original while keeping the same basic shape
5. Uses the specified encoding format (1,0,S,G)

The path from start to goal is possible by moving through the connected dark grey cells (0s), and the overall corridor pattern still forms a "7" shape when viewed as a whole.
