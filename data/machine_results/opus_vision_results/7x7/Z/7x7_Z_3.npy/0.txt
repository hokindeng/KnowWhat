# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in five directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or DIAGONAL
2. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
3. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
4. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (5,1)
- The goal (RED): (1,0)

I need to find a path through the dark grey cells to reach the goal.

From my current position (5,1), I can move to the adjacent cells that are dark grey. Looking at my options:
- UP: (4,1) - dark grey ✓
- DOWN: (6,1) - white wall ✗
- LEFT: (5,0) - dark grey ✓
- RIGHT: (5,2) - dark grey ✓
- Diagonals are blocked by white cells

Moving up to (4,1) appears to be the best choice as it gets me closer to the goal and connects to other dark grey cells that lead upward.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm now at (4,1). Looking at my current position (BLUE), I need to continue moving toward the goal at (1,0).

From (4,1), I can see the following adjacent cells:
- UP: (3,1) - white wall ✗
- DOWN: (5,1) - dark grey (but going backwards)
- LEFT: (4,0) - white wall ✗
- RIGHT: (4,2) - white wall ✗
- DIAGONAL UP-RIGHT: (3,2) - dark grey ✓
- DIAGONAL DOWN-LEFT: (5,0) - dark grey ✓

The best move is to go diagonally up-right to (3,2), which continues my path upward toward the goal.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at (3,2). From my current position (BLUE), I need to continue toward the goal at (1,0).

Looking at the adjacent cells from (3,2):
- UP: (2,2) - white wall ✗
- DOWN: (4,2) - white wall ✗
- LEFT: (3,1) - white wall ✗
- RIGHT: (3,3) - dark grey ✓
- DIAGONAL UP-RIGHT: (2,3) - dark grey ✓
- DIAGONAL DOWN-LEFT: (4,1) - dark grey (but going backwards)

The best move is to go diagonally up-right to (2,3), which continues moving me upward toward the goal.

Next move: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm now at (2,3) and getting closer to the goal at (1,0).

From my current position (BLUE), I can see these adjacent cells:
- UP: (1,3) - dark grey ✓
- DOWN: (3,3) - dark grey (but going backwards)
- LEFT: (2,2) - white wall ✗
- RIGHT: (2,4) - white wall ✗
- DIAGONAL UP-LEFT: (1,2) - dark grey ✓
- DIAGONAL UP-RIGHT: (1,4) - dark grey ✓

The best move is to go straight up to (1,3), which puts me on the same row as the goal.

Next move: (1,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Great! I'm now at (1,3) on the same row as the goal at (1,0). I need to move left to reach the goal.

From my current position (BLUE), I can see these adjacent cells:
- LEFT: (1,2) - dark grey ✓
- RIGHT: (1,4) - dark grey (but moves away from goal)
- UP: (0,3) - dark grey
- DOWN: (2,3) - dark grey (going backwards)

The best move is to go left to (1,2), which moves me closer to the goal.

Next move: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at (1,2) and very close to the goal at (1,0). I just need to continue moving left.

From my current position (BLUE), I can see:
- LEFT: (1,1) - dark grey ✓
- RIGHT: (1,3) - dark grey (but moves away from goal)
- UP: (0,2) - dark grey
- DOWN: (2,2) - white wall ✗

The best move is to continue left to (1,1), which brings me one step away from the goal.

Next move: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm now at (1,1) and I can see the goal (RED cell) directly to my left at (1,0).

From my current position (BLUE), the goal is just one move away:
- LEFT: (1,0) - RED goal cell! ✓

Time to reach the goal!

Next move: (1,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "7" shape. This is evident from the continuous path of dark grey and colored cells that create a horizontal line across row 1, then extends downward through columns 1-3, forming a shape similar to the number "7". The non-wall cells start at the left side of row 1, extend across to position (1,4), then turn downward, creating the vertical segment of the "7".

Part 2: Here is my new "7"-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 S 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This maze maintains the "7" shape pattern of corridors while offering a different path layout than the original. The horizontal line of the "7" runs along row 1, and the vertical segment descends through different columns but maintains the overall "7" shape. There is a valid path from start (S) to goal (G), and the maze uses the same dimensions as the original (7x7).
