# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in five directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or DIAGONAL
2. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
3. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
4. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position: (4,4) - BLUE cell
- Goal position: (6,5) - RED cell
- I need to find a path through the DARK GREY cells

From my current position (4,4), I can see that I'm surrounded by WHITE cells (walls) on most sides. Let me check my valid moves:
- UP (3,4): WHITE - blocked
- DOWN (5,4): DARK GREY - valid
- LEFT (4,3): WHITE - blocked  
- RIGHT (4,5): WHITE - blocked
- DIAGONAL moves: I can move diagonally up-right to (3,5) which is DARK GREY

The best move appears to be diagonally up-right to reach the open path.

Next move: (3,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position (3,5), I can see:
- The goal is at (6,5) - I need to go down eventually
- But there's a wall at (4,5) blocking direct downward movement
- I can see a path of DARK GREY cells in row 2

From (3,5), my valid moves are:
- UP to (2,5): DARK GREY - valid
- DOWN to (4,5): WHITE - blocked
- LEFT to (3,4): WHITE - blocked
- RIGHT to (3,6): WHITE - blocked

I'll move up to access the path in row 2.

Next move: (2,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position (2,5), I need to find a path to the goal at (6,5). I can see a horizontal path of DARK GREY cells in row 2.

From (2,5), my valid moves are:
- UP to (1,5): WHITE - blocked
- DOWN to (3,5): DARK GREY - valid (but I was just there)
- LEFT to (2,4): DARK GREY - valid
- RIGHT to (2,6): DARK GREY - valid

I'll move right to explore more options and possibly find a path down.

Next move: (2,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position (2,6), I'm at the rightmost edge of the dark grey path in row 2. I need to find a way down to reach the goal at (6,5).

From (2,6), my valid moves are:
- UP to (1,6): WHITE - blocked
- DOWN to (3,6): WHITE - blocked
- LEFT to (2,5): DARK GREY - valid

I need to go back left to find another route down.

Next move: (2,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position (2,5), I need to continue exploring the path in row 2 to find a way down to the goal.

From (2,5), my valid moves are:
- UP to (1,5): WHITE - blocked
- DOWN to (3,5): DARK GREY - valid
- LEFT to (2,4): DARK GREY - valid
- RIGHT to (2,6): DARK GREY - valid (but I was just there)

Let me continue left to explore more of the path.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position (2,4), I need to continue exploring the path.

From (2,4), my valid moves are:
- UP to (1,4): WHITE - blocked
- DOWN to (3,4): WHITE - blocked
- LEFT to (2,3): DARK GREY - valid
- RIGHT to (2,5): DARK GREY - valid (but I was just there)

I'll continue left to explore more of the path.

Next move: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position (2,3), I need to continue exploring the path to find a way down.

From (2,3), my valid moves are:
- UP to (1,3): WHITE - blocked
- DOWN to (3,3): WHITE - blocked
- LEFT to (2,2): DARK GREY - valid
- RIGHT to (2,4): DARK GREY - valid (but I was just there)

I'll continue left to explore more of the path.

Next move: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position (2,2), I can see that I can finally move down!

From (2,2), my valid moves are:
- UP to (1,2): WHITE - blocked
- DOWN to (3,2): DARK GREY - valid
- LEFT to (2,1): DARK GREY - valid
- RIGHT to (2,3): DARK GREY - valid (but I was just there)

I'll move down to make progress toward the goal.

Next move: (3,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "T" shape. This is evident from the horizontal line of corridors across row 2 (from column 2 to 6) and the vertical line of corridors extending down from the middle of this horizontal line (from row 3 to row 6, centered around columns 3-4).

Part 2: Here is my new T-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 S 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
```

This maze maintains the T-shape pattern with:
- A horizontal corridor in row 1 forming the top of the T
- A vertical corridor down the middle forming the stem of the T
- Different internal wall placements to create a unique path
- Valid path from start (S) to goal (G)
- Same 7x7 dimensions as the original

The path layout is different from the original while maintaining the same basic T-shaped structure of corridors.
