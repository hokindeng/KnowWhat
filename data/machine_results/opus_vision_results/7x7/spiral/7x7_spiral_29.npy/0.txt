# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see that I'm currently at position (5,3) (the blue cell) and need to reach the goal at (1,3) (the red cell).

Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position:
- UP to (4,3): This is a white cell (wall), so I cannot move there
- DOWN to (6,3): This is a white cell (wall), so I cannot move there  
- LEFT to (5,2): This is a white cell (wall), so I cannot move there
- RIGHT to (5,4): This is a dark grey cell (path), so I can move there

Next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at position (5,4). Let me check my available moves:
- UP to (4,4): This is a white cell (wall), so I cannot move there
- DOWN to (6,4): This is a white cell (wall), so I cannot move there
- LEFT to (5,3): This is a dark grey cell (where I came from)
- RIGHT to (5,5): This is a dark grey cell (path), so I can move there

I'll continue exploring by moving right.

Next move: (5,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at position (5,5). Let me check my available moves:
- UP to (4,5): This is a white cell (wall), so I cannot move there
- DOWN to (6,5): This is a white cell (wall), so I cannot move there
- LEFT to (5,4): This is a dark grey cell (path - where I came from)
- RIGHT to (5,6): This is a white cell (wall), so I cannot move there

I've reached a dead end and need to backtrack.

Next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (5,4). I need to continue backtracking to find another path to the goal. Let me go back to my previous position.

Next move: (5,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at my starting position (5,3). Looking at the maze, I realize I need to find an alternative route since the path to the right leads to a dead end. Let me examine the left side of the maze.

I notice there are dark grey cells at (5,1), but I cannot reach it directly from (5,3) because (5,2) is white (a wall). 

Looking more carefully at the maze, I see that (4,1) is also a dark grey cell. Let me trace possible paths...

Actually, I notice that the only available move from (5,3) is still to go right to (5,4), which I've already explored. 

Let me reconsider the maze structure. Since I can only move through dark grey cells and the cells directly adjacent to (5,3) are:
- (4,3): white
- (6,3): white  
- (5,2): white
- (5,4): dark grey

I must go right again, even though it led to a dead end before. Perhaps I missed something.

Next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (5,4) again. Looking at the maze carefully, I realize there's a problem. From my starting position (5,3), the only accessible dark grey cell is (5,4). From (5,4), I can only go to (5,5) (which is a dead end) or back to (5,3).

The maze appears to have no valid path from the starting position to the goal. The dark grey paths on the left side of the maze (columns 0-2) are not connected to the dark grey paths on the right side (columns 3-5) where I'm currently located.

To verify this, let me check all adjacent cells to my current position (5,4):
- UP (4,4): white cell (wall)
- DOWN (6,4): white cell (wall)
- LEFT (5,3): dark grey cell (where I came from)
- RIGHT (5,5): dark grey cell (dead end)

Since there's no valid path forward, I'll move back to (5,3) to confirm this assessment.

Next move: (5,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at the maze more carefully, I need to find a way to reach the goal at (1,3). Let me trace the dark grey paths systematically.

I notice there's a dark grey cell at (3,3). If I could reach (3,3), I might be able to get to the goal. However, looking at the connections:
- From my position (5,3), I can only reach (5,4) and then (5,5)
- The cells (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) form another group of connected dark grey cells
- But there's no dark grey path connecting my region to that upper region

The maze appears to have two disconnected regions of dark grey paths, making it impossible to reach the goal from my starting position. However, let me try the only available move again to be absolutely certain.

Next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (5,4). Looking at the entire maze, I notice there are dark grey paths on the left side of the maze that could potentially lead to the goal. However, from my current position, I cannot access them because there's no connection between the right side where I am and the left side paths.

Let me check my options from (5,4):
- UP (4,4): white cell (wall)
- DOWN (6,4): white cell (wall)
- LEFT (5,3): dark grey cell
- RIGHT (5,5): dark grey cell

Since I've already explored (5,5) and found it's a dead end, let me continue exploring by going back to see if I missed anything.

Next move: (5,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at this maze very carefully, I need to re-examine all possible paths. From my position at (5,3), let me check all adjacent cells once more:

- UP (4,3): This appears to be a white cell (wall)
- DOWN (6,3): This appears to be a white cell (wall)  
- LEFT (5,2): This appears to be a white cell (wall)
- RIGHT (5,4): This is a dark grey cell (path)

Based on the maze structure, it appears that the dark grey paths form disconnected regions, and there's no valid path from my starting position to the goal. However, since this is a maze-solving task that should have a solution, I'll continue with the only available move.

Next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (5,4) again. Looking at the maze structure, I can see that:

1. The goal at (1,3) is part of a network of dark grey cells on the left side of the maze
2. My current position is part of a small network on the right side consisting only of cells (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5)
3. These two networks are not connected by any dark grey paths

From (5,4), my only options are:
- LEFT to (5,3) - already visited
- RIGHT to (5,5) - leads to a dead end

The maze appears to have no valid solution as the starting position and goal are in disconnected regions. However, I'll continue with the only unexplored move to confirm this.

Next move: (5,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (5,5), which is a dead end. Let me check my options:
- UP (4,5): white cell (wall)
- DOWN (6,5): white cell (wall)
- LEFT (5,4): dark grey cell (path)
- RIGHT (5,6): white cell (wall)

I can only go back. I've now explored all possible paths from my starting position. The accessible area consists only of cells (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5), which form an isolated region not connected to the goal at (1,3).

This maze appears to be unsolvable as there is no valid path from the starting position to the goal. The dark grey paths form disconnected regions.

Next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (5,4). I have now fully explored all accessible paths from my starting position. The accessible region consists only of:
- (5,3) - starting position
- (5,4) - current position  
- (5,5) - dead end

These three cells form an isolated pocket with no connection to the rest of the maze or the goal. Based on my exploration, this maze appears to have no valid solution as the starting position and goal are in disconnected regions.

However, I'll continue moving back to complete the exploration.

Next move: (5,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at the starting position (5,3). I have thoroughly explored all accessible paths:

- From (5,3): Can only move to (5,4)
- From (5,4): Can move to (5,5) or back to (5,3)
- From (5,5): Can only move back to (5,4)

The maze appears to have no valid path from the starting position to the goal at (1,3). The starting area is isolated from the rest of the maze by white cells (walls) on all sides except the path to (5,4).

Since I've exhausted all possibilities, I'll make the only available move again.

Next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (5,4) again. Based on my complete exploration of the maze, I have confirmed that:

1. The starting position (5,3) is part of a small isolated region containing only cells (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5)
2. This region has no connection to the rest of the maze where the goal (1,3) is located
3. The maze appears to be unsolvable due to these disconnected regions

However, I'll continue moving within the available space. Let me go back to the starting position.

Next move: (5,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (5,3). I have thoroughly confirmed that this maze has no solution - the starting area is completely isolated from the goal. The only accessible cells from my starting position are:

- (5,3) - current position
- (5,4) - one step right
- (5,5) - two steps right (dead end)

These three cells are surrounded by white cells (walls) with no connection to the rest of the maze. The goal at (1,3) is in a separate, unreachable region.

Since I must provide a move, I'll go to the only available adjacent cell.

Next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (5,4) once again. I've conclusively demonstrated that this maze cannot be solved - the starting position is in a completely isolated region with no path to the goal. The only reachable cells from the starting position are (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5).

However, since I must continue to provide moves, I'll move to the remaining cell.

Next move: (5,5)

SOLVE: FAIL

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "T" shape. This is evident from looking at all the dark grey cells (including start and goal positions) which create a horizontal line at the top (cells 1,1 through 1,5) and a vertical line down the middle (cells 3,3 through 5,4).

Part 2: Here is my new T-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 S 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This maze:
- Maintains the T-shape pattern with a horizontal corridor at the top and vertical corridor down the middle
- Has valid dimensions (7x7)
- Has a valid path from start (S) to goal (G)
- Is different from the original maze but keeps the same general shape
- Uses the specified encoding format (1, 0, S, G)

The path from start to goal is straightforward: go up from S to reach the horizontal corridor, then left to reach G.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
