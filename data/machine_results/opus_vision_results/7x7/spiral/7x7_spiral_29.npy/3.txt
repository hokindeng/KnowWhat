# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (5,3)
- The goal (RED): (1,3)
- I need to find a path through the dark grey cells

From my current position at (5,3), let me check the adjacent cells:
- UP (4,3): This is a white cell (wall) - cannot move here
- DOWN (6,3): This is a white cell (wall) - cannot move here  
- LEFT (5,2): This is a white cell (wall) - cannot move here
- RIGHT (5,4): This is a dark grey cell (path) - I can move here!

Next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at position (5,4). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP (4,4): White cell (wall) - cannot move
- DOWN (6,4): White cell (wall) - cannot move  
- LEFT (5,3): Dark grey cell (where I came from) - can move but not helpful
- RIGHT (5,5): Dark grey cell (path) - I can move here!

Next move: (5,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at position (5,5). Looking at my adjacent cells:
- UP (4,5): White cell (wall) - cannot move
- DOWN (6,5): White cell (wall) - cannot move
- LEFT (5,4): Dark grey cell - I can move here (backtracking)
- RIGHT (5,6): White cell (wall) - cannot move

I've reached a dead end. I need to backtrack to find another path.

Next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (5,4). I need to continue backtracking to find a different path to the goal. Let me go back to my previous position.

Next move: (5,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (5,3), my starting position. Looking at the maze, I need to find a different route. Let me check the cells to my left. I can see that (5,1) is a dark grey cell (path) that I can reach.

From (5,3), I need to go to (5,2) first, but looking at the maze, (5,2) appears to be white (wall). However, (5,1) is dark grey. I'll need to find another way.

Let me reconsider the available paths. Looking up from my position, (4,3) is white, but (3,3) is dark grey. I need to find a way to reach (3,3).

Since I can't go directly up or left from (5,3), and going right leads to a dead end, I need to find an alternate route through the left side of the maze.

Looking more carefully at the grid, I can see (5,1) is a dark grey path. To get there from (5,3), I would need to go through (5,2), but that appears to be blocked.

Wait, I need to look more carefully. From (5,3), I should check all adjacent cells again. Looking at the path cells (dark grey), I can see there's a route through the left side of the maze.

Let me try going to (5,2) to see if it's actually passable.

Next move: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Great! I'm now at (5,2). Looking at my adjacent cells:
- UP (4,2): White cell (wall) - cannot move
- DOWN (6,2): White cell (wall) - cannot move  
- LEFT (5,1): Dark grey cell (path) - I can move here!
- RIGHT (5,3): Dark grey cell (where I came from)

I'll continue moving left to explore this path.

Next move: (5,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (5,1). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP (4,1): Dark grey cell (path) - I can move here!
- DOWN (6,1): White cell (wall) - cannot move
- LEFT (5,0): White cell (wall) - cannot move
- RIGHT (5,2): Dark grey cell (where I came from)

I'll move up to continue exploring this path.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,1). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP (3,1): Dark grey cell (path) - I can move here!
- DOWN (5,1): Dark grey cell (where I came from)
- LEFT (4,0): White cell (wall) - cannot move
- RIGHT (4,2): White cell (wall) - cannot move

I'll continue moving up.

Next move: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,1). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP (2,1): Dark grey cell (path) - I can move here!
- DOWN (4,1): Dark grey cell (where I came from)
- LEFT (3,0): White cell (wall) - cannot move
- RIGHT (3,2): White cell (wall) - cannot move

I'll continue moving up towards the goal.

Next move: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (2,1). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP (1,1): Dark grey cell (path) - I can move here!
- DOWN (3,1): Dark grey cell (where I came from)
- LEFT (2,0): Dark grey cell (path) - I can move here
- RIGHT (2,2): White cell (wall) - cannot move

I'll move up to get closer to the goal row.

Next move: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (1,1) and the goal is at (1,3). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP (0,1): White cell (wall) - cannot move
- DOWN (2,1): Dark grey cell (where I came from)
- LEFT (1,0): Dark grey cell (path) - I can move here
- RIGHT (1,2): Dark grey cell (path) - I can move here!

Since the goal is at (1,3), I'll move right to get closer.

Next move: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (1,2) and I can see the goal (RED cell) is right next to me at (1,3). 

Next move: (1,3)

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "T" shape. This is evident from the vertical corridor running from row 5 to row 1 along column 1, which then intersects with a horizontal corridor across row 1 from column 1 to column 5. Together, these corridors create a clear "T" pattern in the grid.

Part 2: Here is my new T-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 S 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- I maintained the T-shape pattern
- The vertical line of the T is in column 3 (instead of column 1 in the original)
- The horizontal line of the T is in row 1 (same as original)
- Start and goal positions are placed along the T pattern
- There is a valid path from S to G
- The overall shape is the same but the layout is different from the original
