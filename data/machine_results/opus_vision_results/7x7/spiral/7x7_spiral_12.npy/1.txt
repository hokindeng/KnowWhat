# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (3,4)
- The goal (RED): (3,6)

From my current position at (3,4), I need to check the adjacent cells:
- UP: (2,4) - This is a dark grey path cell, I can move here
- DOWN: (4,4) - This is a dark grey path cell, I can move here
- LEFT: (3,3) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here
- RIGHT: (3,5) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here

Since I need to reach (3,6) which is to the right, and I can't move directly right due to the wall at (3,5), I'll need to find an alternate path. I'll start by moving up to explore that route.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at position (2,4). Looking at my adjacent cells:
- UP: (1,4) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here
- DOWN: (3,4) - This is a dark grey path cell (where I came from), I can move here
- LEFT: (2,3) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here
- RIGHT: (2,5) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here

This appears to be a dead end. I need to go back down and try a different route.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (3,4). Since going up led to a dead end, I'll now try going down to explore the other path.

From my current position at (3,4), checking adjacent cells:
- UP: (2,4) - Dark grey path (but that was a dead end)
- DOWN: (4,4) - This is a dark grey path cell, I can move here
- LEFT: (3,3) - White wall, cannot move
- RIGHT: (3,5) - White wall, cannot move

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at (4,4). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP: (3,4) - Dark grey path (where I came from)
- DOWN: (5,4) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here
- LEFT: (4,3) - This is a dark grey path cell, I can move here
- RIGHT: (4,5) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here

I'll move left to continue exploring.

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at (4,3). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP: (3,3) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here
- DOWN: (5,3) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here
- LEFT: (4,2) - This is a dark grey path cell, I can move here
- RIGHT: (4,4) - Dark grey path (where I came from)

I'll continue moving left to explore further.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at (4,2). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP: (3,2) - This is a dark grey path cell, I can move here
- DOWN: (5,2) - This is a dark grey path cell, I can move here
- LEFT: (4,1) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here
- RIGHT: (4,3) - Dark grey path (where I came from)

Since the goal is at row 3 (same row as (3,6)), I'll move up to get to the same row level.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at (3,2), on the same row as the goal at (3,6). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP: (2,2) - This is a dark grey path cell, I can move here
- DOWN: (4,2) - Dark grey path (where I came from)
- LEFT: (3,1) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here
- RIGHT: (3,3) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here

I can't move directly right toward the goal, so I'll go up to find another route.

Next move: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at (2,2). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP: (1,2) - This is a dark grey path cell, I can move here
- DOWN: (3,2) - Dark grey path (where I came from)
- LEFT: (2,1) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here
- RIGHT: (2,3) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here

I'll continue moving up to explore the path.

Next move: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at (1,2). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP: (0,2) - This is a dark grey path cell, I can move here
- DOWN: (2,2) - Dark grey path (where I came from)
- LEFT: (1,1) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here
- RIGHT: (1,3) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here

I'll move up to continue exploring the top row.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at (0,2). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP: No cell (edge of maze)
- DOWN: (1,2) - Dark grey path (where I came from)
- LEFT: (0,1) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here
- RIGHT: (0,3) - This is a dark grey path cell, I can move here

Great! I can move right along the top row to get closer to the goal.

Next move: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at (0,3). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP: No cell (edge of maze)
- DOWN: (1,3) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here
- LEFT: (0,2) - Dark grey path (where I came from)
- RIGHT: (0,4) - This is a dark grey path cell, I can move here

I'll continue moving right along the top row.

Next move: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at (0,4). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP: No cell (edge of maze)
- DOWN: (1,4) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here
- LEFT: (0,3) - Dark grey path (where I came from)
- RIGHT: (0,5) - This is a dark grey path cell, I can move here

I'll continue moving right.

Next move: (0,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at (0,5). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP: No cell (edge of maze)
- DOWN: (1,5) - This is a white wall, I cannot move here
- LEFT: (0,4) - Dark grey path (where I came from)
- RIGHT: (0,6) - This is a dark grey path cell, I can move here

I'll continue moving right to reach column 6, where the goal is located.

Next move: (0,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at (0,6), in the same column as the goal at (3,6). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP: No cell (edge of maze)
- DOWN: (1,6) - This is a dark grey path cell, I can move here
- LEFT: (0,5) - Dark grey path (where I came from)
- RIGHT: No cell (edge of maze)

Perfect! I can now move down towards the goal.

Next move: (1,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at (1,6). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP: (0,6) - Dark grey path (where I came from)
- DOWN: (2,6) - This is a dark grey path cell, I can move here

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "T" shape. This is evident from the horizontal line of corridors across the top row (0,2 through 0,6) intersecting with a vertical line of corridors down the right side (0,6 through 3,6), creating a clear T-shaped pattern of accessible cells.

Part 2: Here is my new T-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 S
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The horizontal part of the T is along row 0, columns 2-6
- The vertical part of the T is along column 6, rows 0-3
- The start (S) and goal (G) positions are placed along the vertical part
- The layout is different from the original but maintains the T shape
- There is a valid path from S to G
- The dimensions are identical (7x7)
- The overall T shape pattern is preserved while creating a different solving experience
