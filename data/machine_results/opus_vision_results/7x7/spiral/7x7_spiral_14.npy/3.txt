# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see my current position at (2,2) marked in blue, and the goal at (3,6) marked in red.

From my current position, I can move:
- UP to (1,2) - which is a dark grey path
- DOWN to (3,2) - which is a dark grey path
- LEFT to (2,1) - blocked by white wall
- RIGHT to (2,3) - blocked by white wall

I'll start by moving down to get closer to the goal's row.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm now at (3,2). I can see the goal is at (3,6) on the same row, but I need to find a path around the walls.

From my current position, I can move:
- UP to (2,2) - dark grey path (but I just came from there)
- DOWN to (4,2) - dark grey path
- LEFT to (3,1) - blocked by white wall
- RIGHT to (3,3) - blocked by white wall

I'll continue moving down to explore the lower path.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (4,2). Looking at the available paths:

From my current position, I can move:
- UP to (3,2) - dark grey path (but I just came from there)
- DOWN to (5,2) - dark grey path
- LEFT to (4,1) - blocked by white wall
- RIGHT to (4,3) - blocked by white wall

I'll continue down to explore the path further.

Next move: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (5,2). Let me check my options:

From my current position, I can move:
- UP to (4,2) - dark grey path (but I just came from there)
- DOWN to (6,2) - blocked by white wall
- LEFT to (5,1) - blocked by white wall
- RIGHT to (5,3) - dark grey path!

Great! I can finally move right towards the goal.

Next move: (5,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (5,3). Looking at my options:

From my current position, I can move:
- UP to (4,3) - blocked by white wall
- DOWN to (6,3) - blocked by white wall
- LEFT to (5,2) - dark grey path (but I just came from there)
- RIGHT to (5,4) - dark grey path

I'll continue moving right towards the goal.

Next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (5,4). Let me check my options:

From my current position, I can move:
- UP to (4,4) - blocked by white wall
- DOWN to (6,4) - blocked by white wall
- LEFT to (5,3) - dark grey path (but I just came from there)
- RIGHT to (5,5) - dark grey path

I'll continue moving right.

Next move: (5,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (5,5). Let me check my options:

From my current position, I can move:
- UP to (4,5) - blocked by white wall
- DOWN to (6,5) - blocked by white wall
- LEFT to (5,4) - dark grey path (but I just came from there)
- RIGHT to (5,6) - dark grey path

I'll continue moving right to get to column 6.

Next move: (5,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (5,6). I'm in the same column as the goal, which is at (3,6). Let me check my options:

From my current position, I can move:
- UP to (4,6) - dark grey path
- DOWN to (6,6) - blocked by white wall
- LEFT to (5,5) - dark grey path (but I just came from there)
- RIGHT - no cell (edge of maze)

I'll move up to get closer to the goal.

Next move: (4,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at (4,6) and the goal is directly above me at (3,6). 

From my current position, I can move:
- UP to (3,6) - this is the RED goal cell!
- DOWN to (5,6) - dark grey path (but I just came from there)
- LEFT to (4,5) - blocked by white wall
- RIGHT - no cell (edge of maze)

I'll move up to reach the goal.

Next move: (3,6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "T" shape. This is evident from the vertical line of corridors running down column 2, and the horizontal line of corridors across row 5, forming a clear T-shaped pattern when viewed as a whole. The non-wall cells create a path that extends down the middle and then branches right at the bottom.

Part 2: Here is my new T-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 S 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This maze maintains the T-shape pattern with:
- A vertical corridor running down the middle (column 2)
- A horizontal corridor at the bottom (row 5)
- The start position (S) placed in the upper portion of the vertical line
- The goal position (G) placed at the end of the horizontal line
- Valid path exists from S to G
- Different layout from original while maintaining the same basic shape

The maze is solvable by going down the vertical corridor and then following the horizontal path to reach the goal.
