# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (5,2)
- The goal (RED): (3,4)
- Dark grey paths I can move through
- White walls I cannot pass

From my current position at (5,2), I can move:
- UP to (4,2) - this is a dark grey path cell
- DOWN to (6,2) - this is a dark grey path cell
- LEFT to (5,1) - this is white (wall), so I cannot go there
- RIGHT to (5,3) - this is white (wall), so I cannot go there

To reach the goal at (3,4), I need to move upward first. 

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good! I've successfully moved from (5,2) to (4,2). 

Now from my current position at (4,2), I need to continue toward the goal at (3,4). Looking at my options:
- UP to (3,2) - this is a dark grey path cell
- DOWN to (5,2) - this is where I came from
- LEFT to (4,1) - this is white (wall)
- RIGHT to (4,3) - this is white (wall)

I'll continue moving upward to get closer to the goal.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm now at (3,2), on the same row as the goal at (3,4). However, I need to check my path options:

From my current position at (3,2):
- UP to (2,2) - this is a dark grey path cell
- DOWN to (4,2) - this is where I came from
- LEFT to (3,1) - this is white (wall)
- RIGHT to (3,3) - this is white (wall)

I cannot move directly right to (3,3) because it's a wall. I need to go around by moving up first.

Next move: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm now at (2,2). Let me check my movement options:

From my current position at (2,2):
- UP to (1,2) - this is white (wall)
- DOWN to (3,2) - this is a dark grey path cell
- LEFT to (2,1) - this is white (wall)  
- RIGHT to (2,3) - this is white (wall)

I see that I can't continue right from here due to walls. I need to go back down and find another route.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (3,2). Since I can't go directly right to the goal due to walls, I need to find an alternative route. Let me continue exploring downward.

From my current position at (3,2):
- UP to (2,2) - already tried, leads to dead end
- DOWN to (4,2) - this is a dark grey path cell
- LEFT to (3,1) - white (wall)
- RIGHT to (3,3) - white (wall)

I'll continue down to explore other paths.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (4,2). Since I can't move directly right due to walls, I need to continue exploring. Let me go down to see if there's a path that leads around.

From my current position at (4,2):
- UP to (3,2) - already explored that direction
- DOWN to (5,2) - this is a dark grey path cell
- LEFT to (4,1) - white (wall)
- RIGHT to (4,3) - white (wall)

Next move: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at my starting position (5,2). I've explored the upward path but couldn't reach the goal from there. Let me try going down to see if there's an alternative route.

From my current position at (5,2):
- UP to (4,2) - already explored that direction
- DOWN to (6,2) - this is a dark grey path cell
- LEFT to (5,1) - white (wall)
- RIGHT to (5,3) - white (wall)

Next move: (6,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm at (6,2). Now let me check my movement options:

From my current position at (6,2):
- UP to (5,2) - this is where I came from
- DOWN - I'm at the bottom row, can't go further down
- LEFT to (6,1) - white (wall)
- RIGHT to (6,3) - this is a dark grey path cell

I can move right. Let me explore this direction.

Next move: (6,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm now at (6,3). Let me check my options:

From my current position at (6,3):
- UP to (5,3) - white (wall)
- DOWN - I'm at the bottom row
- LEFT to (6,2) - where I came from
- RIGHT to (6,4) - this is a dark grey path cell

I'll continue right to explore this path.

Next move: (6,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (6,4), which is in the same column as the goal at (3,4). Let me check if I can go up:

From my current position at (6,4):
- UP to (5,4) - white (wall)
- DOWN - I'm at the bottom row
- LEFT to (6,3) - where I came from
- RIGHT to (6,5) - this is a dark grey path cell

I can't go directly up due to a wall, so I'll continue exploring to the right.

Next move: (6,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm at (6,5). Let me check my movement options:

From my current position at (6,5):
- UP to (5,5) - white (wall)
- DOWN - I'm at the bottom row
- LEFT to (6,4) - where I came from
- RIGHT to (6,6) - this is a dark grey path cell

I'll continue right to explore further.

Next move: (6,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (6,6), the bottom-right corner. Let me check my options:

From my current position at (6,6):
- UP to (5,6) - this is a dark grey path cell
- DOWN - I'm at the bottom edge
- LEFT to (6,5) - where I came from
- RIGHT - I'm at the right edge

I can finally go up! This might lead me toward the goal.

Next move: (5,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Great! I'm at (5,6). Let me check my options:

From my current position at (5,6):
- UP to (4,6) - this is a dark grey path cell
- DOWN to (6,6) - where I came from
- LEFT to (5,5) - white (wall)
- RIGHT - I'm at the right edge

I can continue going up!

Next move: (4,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm at (4,6). Let me check my options:

From my current position at (4,6):
- UP to (3,6) - this is a dark grey path cell
- DOWN to (5,6) - where I came from
- LEFT to (4,5) - white (wall)
- RIGHT - I'm at the right edge

I can continue up to get to row 3, the same row as the goal!

Next move: (3,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (3,6), on the same row as the goal at (3,4). Let me check my options:

From my current position at (3,6):
- UP to (2,6) - this is a dark grey path cell
- DOWN to (4,6) - where I came from
- LEFT to (3,5) - white (wall)
- RIGHT - I'm at the right edge

I can't go directly left due to a wall. I need to go up to find another path.

Next move: (2,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (2,6). Let me check my movement options:

From my current position at (2,6):
- UP to (1,6) - white (wall)
- DOWN to (3,6) - where I came from
- LEFT to (2,5) - this is a dark grey path cell
- RIGHT - I'm at the right edge

I can go left!

Next move: (2,5)

SOLVE: FAIL

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "T" shape. This is evident from the vertical line of corridors running from row 2 to row 6 in column 2, intersecting with a horizontal line of corridors across row 2 (from column 4 to column 6), creating a clear T-shaped pattern.

Part 2: Here is my new T-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 S
1 1 0 1 G 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This maze maintains the T-shape pattern with:
- A vertical corridor running down column 2
- A horizontal corridor across row 2
- Start and goal positions placed along the T pattern
- Different path layout from the original while maintaining the same basic shape
- Valid path exists from S to G
- Same 7x7 dimensions as the original maze

The path layout is different from the original but preserves the T-shaped corridor structure, and provides a challenging but solvable route from start to goal.
