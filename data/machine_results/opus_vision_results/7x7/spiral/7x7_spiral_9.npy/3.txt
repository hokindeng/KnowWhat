# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (5,2)
- Goal position (RED): (3,4)
- I need to navigate through the dark grey paths

From my current position at (5,2), I can move:
- UP to (4,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- DOWN to (6,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (5,1) - this is white (wall, invalid)
- RIGHT to (5,3) - this is white (wall, invalid)

To reach the goal at (3,4), I need to move upward. Therefore, my best move is to go up.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I've moved up to (4,2). Now I need to continue toward the goal at (3,4).

From my current position at (4,2), I can move:
- UP to (3,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- DOWN to (5,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (4,1) - this is white (wall, invalid)
- RIGHT to (4,3) - this is white (wall, invalid)

I need to continue moving up to get closer to the goal's row.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at (3,2), on the same row as the goal at (3,4). However, I need to check my movement options.

From my current position at (3,2), I can move:
- UP to (2,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- DOWN to (4,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (3,1) - this is white (wall, invalid)
- RIGHT to (3,3) - this is white (wall, invalid)

Since I can't move directly right to the goal, I need to go around. I'll move up first.

Next move: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm at (2,2). Now I need to find a path to the goal at (3,4).

From my current position at (2,2), I can move:
- UP to (1,2) - this is white (wall, invalid)
- DOWN to (3,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (2,1) - this is white (wall, invalid)
- RIGHT to (2,3) - this is white (wall, invalid)

It seems I can only move back down. Looking at the maze, I'll need to find another route to reach the goal.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (3,2). Since I can't go directly right to the goal, I need to find another route. Let me go down to explore alternative paths.

From my current position at (3,2), I can move:
- UP to (2,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- DOWN to (4,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (3,1) - this is white (wall, invalid)
- RIGHT to (3,3) - this is white (wall, invalid)

I'll go down to find a path that allows me to move right.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,2). Let me continue exploring downward to find a path that leads right.

From my current position at (4,2), I can move:
- UP to (3,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- DOWN to (5,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (4,1) - this is white (wall, invalid)
- RIGHT to (4,3) - this is white (wall, invalid)

I'll continue down to find another route.

Next move: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (5,2). I need to find a different route. Let me go down further to explore the bottom path.

From my current position at (5,2), I can move:
- UP to (4,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- DOWN to (6,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (5,1) - this is white (wall, invalid)
- RIGHT to (5,3) - this is white (wall, invalid)

I'll go down to explore the bottom route.

Next move: (6,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good! I'm at (6,2) at the bottom of the maze. Now I can move right!

From my current position at (6,2), I can move:
- UP to (5,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- DOWN - out of bounds (invalid)
- LEFT to (6,1) - this is white (wall, invalid)
- RIGHT to (6,3) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)

I'll move right to start making progress horizontally.

Next move: (6,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm at (6,3) and making progress. Now I need to continue moving right.

From my current position at (6,3), I can move:
- UP to (5,3) - this is white (wall, invalid)
- DOWN - out of bounds (invalid)
- LEFT to (6,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- RIGHT to (6,4) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)

I'll continue moving right to get to column 4 where the goal is.

Next move: (6,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (6,4), in the same column as the goal. Now I need to move up to reach it at (3,4).

From my current position at (6,4), I can move:
- UP to (5,4) - this is white (wall, invalid)
- DOWN - out of bounds (invalid)
- LEFT to (6,3) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- RIGHT to (6,5) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)

Since I can't move directly up, I need to continue right to find an upward path.

Next move: (6,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (6,5). Let me continue exploring to find an upward path.

From my current position at (6,5), I can move:
- UP to (5,5) - this is white (wall, invalid)
- DOWN - out of bounds (invalid)
- LEFT to (6,4) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- RIGHT to (6,6) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)

I'll move right to continue exploring.

Next move: (6,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (6,6), the far right corner. Now I can move up!

From my current position at (6,6), I can move:
- UP to (5,6) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- DOWN - out of bounds (invalid)
- LEFT to (6,5) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- RIGHT - out of bounds (invalid)

I'll move up to start making my way toward the goal.

Next move: (5,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good! I'm at (5,6) and moving upward. I'll continue going up.

From my current position at (5,6), I can move:
- UP to (4,6) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- DOWN to (6,6) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (5,5) - this is white (wall, invalid)
- RIGHT - out of bounds (invalid)

I'll continue moving up toward the goal.

Next move: (4,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm at (4,6), getting closer to the goal at (3,4). I'll continue moving up.

From my current position at (4,6), I can move:

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "T" shape. This is evident from the vertical corridor running from row 2 to row 6 in column 2, and the horizontal corridor at the top of the T spanning from column 4 to column 6 in rows 2 and 3. The overall pattern of dark grey cells clearly resembles a capital letter T rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

Part 2: Here is my new T-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 0 S
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The vertical line of the T is formed by a corridor in column 2
- The horizontal part of the T is in row 2, spanning columns 4-6
- The start (S) and goal (G) positions are placed along the horizontal bar
- The T shape is maintained but the path solution is different from the original
- The maze maintains the 7x7 dimensions of the original

The maze is valid and solvable while maintaining the same basic T shape as the original maze.
