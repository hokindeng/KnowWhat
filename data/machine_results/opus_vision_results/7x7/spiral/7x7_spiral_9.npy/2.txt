# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE cell): (5,2)
- The goal (RED cell): (3,4)
- I can move to adjacent dark grey cells only

From my current position at (5,2), I can move:
- UP to (4,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- DOWN to (6,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (5,1) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)
- RIGHT to (5,3) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)

Since the goal is at (3,4) which is above me, I'll move up to get closer.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position at (4,2):
- My current position (BLUE cell): (4,2)
- The goal (RED cell): (3,4)

From (4,2), I can move:
- UP to (3,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- DOWN to (5,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid but moving away from goal)
- LEFT to (4,1) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)
- RIGHT to (4,3) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)

I'll move up to get to the same row as the goal.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position at (3,2):
- My current position (BLUE cell): (3,2)
- The goal (RED cell): (3,4)

I'm on the same row as the goal, but I can't move directly right because (3,3) is a white cell (wall).

From (3,2), I can move:
- UP to (2,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- DOWN to (4,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (3,1) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)
- RIGHT to (3,3) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)

I need to find a path around the wall. I'll move up to explore an alternate route.

Next move: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position at (2,2):
- My current position (BLUE cell): (2,2)
- The goal (RED cell): (3,4)

From (2,2), I can move:
- UP to (1,2) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)
- DOWN to (3,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (2,1) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)
- RIGHT to (2,3) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)

I can only move down from here. I'll go back down to explore other paths.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position at (3,2):
- My current position (BLUE cell): (3,2)
- The goal (RED cell): (3,4)

I've already tried going up, which was a dead end. Now I'll explore going down to find an alternative path.

From (3,2), I can move:
- UP to (2,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid but already tried)
- DOWN to (4,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (3,1) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)
- RIGHT to (3,3) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)

I'll move down to explore a different route.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position at (4,2):
- My current position (BLUE cell): (4,2)
- The goal (RED cell): (3,4)

From (4,2), I can move:
- UP to (3,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid but just came from there)
- DOWN to (5,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (4,1) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)
- RIGHT to (4,3) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)

I'll continue down to explore further. I notice (4,4) is a dark grey cell directly below the goal, so I may need to find a path that goes around.

Next move: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position at (5,2):
- My current position (BLUE cell): (5,2)
- The goal (RED cell): (3,4)

From (5,2), I can move:
- UP to (4,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid but just came from there)
- DOWN to (6,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (5,1) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)
- RIGHT to (5,3) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)

I'll continue down to explore the bottom path.

Next move: (6,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position at (6,2):
- My current position (BLUE cell): (6,2)

- UP to (5,3) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)
- DOWN - I'm at the bottom row, cannot move down
- LEFT to (6,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid but just came from there)
- RIGHT to (6,4) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)

I'll continue moving right along the bottom path.

Next move: (6,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position at (6,4):
- My current position (BLUE cell): (6,4)
- The goal (RED cell): (3,4)

I'm directly below the goal! From (6,4), I can move:
- UP to (5,4) - this is a white cell (invalid - wall)
- DOWN - I'm at the bottom row, cannot move down
- LEFT to (6,3) - this is a dark grey cell (valid but just came from there)
- RIGHT to (6,5) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)

I need to continue exploring to find a path up. I'll move right.

SOLVE: FAIL

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "T" shape. This is evident from the vertical line of corridors running down the middle column (column 2) and a horizontal line across the top (connecting columns 4, 5, and 6 in row 2). Together, these corridors create an inverted "T" pattern.

Part 2: Here is my new T-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 S
1 1 0 1 G 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This maze maintains the T-shape pattern with:
- A vertical corridor running down column 2
- A horizontal corridor across row 2 connecting to the right side
- The start (S) and goal (G) positions are placed in different locations than the original
- There is a valid path from S to G
- The overall dimensions are preserved (7x7)
- The basic T-shape is maintained but with slight variations in the corridor width and exact positioning
