# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (3,3)
- The goal (RED): (5,5)
- I need to find a path through the dark grey cells

From my current position (3,3), let me check the adjacent cells:
- UP (2,3): White - blocked
- DOWN (4,3): White - blocked  
- LEFT (3,2): Dark grey - accessible
- RIGHT (3,4): White - blocked

My only valid move is to go LEFT.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at position (3,2). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP (2,2): White - blocked
- DOWN (4,2): White - blocked
- LEFT (3,1): Dark grey - accessible
- RIGHT (3,3): Dark grey - accessible (where I came from)

I'll continue moving LEFT to explore the path.

Next move: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at position (3,1). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP (2,1): White - blocked
- DOWN (4,1): Dark grey - accessible
- LEFT (3,0): White - blocked
- RIGHT (3,2): Dark grey - accessible (where I came from)

I'll move DOWN to continue exploring the maze.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at position (4,1). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP (3,1): Dark grey - accessible (where I came from)
- DOWN (5,1): Dark grey - accessible
- LEFT (4,0): White - blocked
- RIGHT (4,2): White - blocked

I'll move DOWN to continue toward the goal.

Next move: (5,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at position (5,1). Let me check my adjacent cells:
- UP (4,1): Dark grey - accessible (where I came from)
- DOWN (6,1): White - blocked
- LEFT (5,0): White - blocked
- RIGHT (5,2): White - blocked

I've reached a dead end. I need to backtrack and find another path to the goal. I'll go back UP.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (4,1). I need to continue backtracking since the downward path was a dead end. Let me go back UP to find an alternative route to the goal.

Next move: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (3,1). I need to continue backtracking to explore other paths. Let me go RIGHT to return to where I started exploring.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (3,2). Since the left path led to a dead end, I need to go back to my starting point and explore other directions. Let me go RIGHT.

Next move: (3,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at my starting position (3,3). Looking at the maze more carefully, I notice there's a path through the upper rows. From (3,3), I need to find a way to reach the goal at (5,5).

Let me check my options again from (3,3):
- UP (2,3): White - blocked
- DOWN (4,3): White - blocked  
- LEFT (3,2): Dark grey - accessible (already explored)
- RIGHT (3,4): White - blocked

Since I can't go up directly, I need to go left first and find another route. Let me go LEFT again.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,2). Looking at the maze more carefully, I notice that I need to find a way to reach the upper path. Let me check if I can go up by first going left to (3,1).

Next move: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,1). I've already explored the downward path which leads to a dead end. I need to go back and find another route. Let me go RIGHT.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (3,2). Looking at the maze more carefully, I notice that (3,0) is actually dark grey! Let me go LEFT to (3,1) first.

Next move: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Now I'm at (3,1). Looking at my adjacent cells:
- UP (2,1): White - blocked
- DOWN (4,1): Dark grey - accessible (but leads to dead end)
- LEFT (3,0): Dark grey - accessible! This is a new path to explore
- RIGHT (3,2): Dark grey - accessible (where I came from)

Let me go LEFT to explore this new path.

Next move: (3,0)

SOLVE: FAIL

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "T" shape. This is evident from how the non-wall cells create a horizontal line across row 1 (from columns 1-5) and a vertical line down column 1 (from rows 3-5), forming a T-shaped pattern of corridors.

Part 2: Here is my new T-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This maze:
- Maintains the T-shape pattern of corridors
- Has different path layout than original
- Has valid path from S to G
- Uses same dimensions (7x7)
- Follows the encoding format
- Places start (S) in top corridor of T
- Places goal (G) in bottom of T's vertical stem
- Creates a challenging but solvable path

The T-shape is preserved while creating a different solving experience than the original maze.
