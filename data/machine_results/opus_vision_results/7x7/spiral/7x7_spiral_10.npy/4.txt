# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE cell): (5,6)
- The goal (RED cell): (1,6)
- I need to find a path through the dark grey cells

From my current position at (5,6), I can see that:
- UP (4,6) is a white wall - cannot move there
- DOWN (6,6) is a white wall - cannot move there  
- LEFT (5,5) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- RIGHT would be out of bounds

My only valid move is to go LEFT.

Next move: (5,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I successfully moved to (5,5). Now I need to continue finding a path to the goal at (1,6).

From my current position at (5,5), I can see:
- UP (4,5) is a white wall - cannot move there
- DOWN (6,5) is a white wall - cannot move there
- LEFT (5,4) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- RIGHT (5,6) is where I just came from

I'll continue moving LEFT to explore the path.

Next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (5,4). Looking at my options:
- UP (4,4) is a white wall - cannot move there
- DOWN (6,4) is a white wall - cannot move there
- LEFT (5,3) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- RIGHT (5,5) is where I came from

I'll continue moving LEFT along the path.

Next move: (5,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (5,3). Checking my surroundings:
- UP (4,3) is a white wall - cannot move there
- DOWN (6,3) is a white wall - cannot move there
- LEFT (5,2) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- RIGHT (5,4) is where I came from

Continuing LEFT along the path.

Next move: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (5,2). Looking at my options:
- UP (4,2) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- DOWN (6,2) is a white wall - cannot move there
- LEFT (5,1) is a white wall - cannot move there
- RIGHT (5,3) is where I came from

I need to go UP to make progress toward the goal.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,2). Checking my options:
- UP (3,2) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- DOWN (5,2) is where I came from
- LEFT (4,1) is a white wall - cannot move there
- RIGHT (4,3) is a white wall - cannot move there

I'll continue moving UP toward the goal.

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,2). Checking my surroundings:
- UP (2,2) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- DOWN (4,2) is where I came from
- LEFT (3,1) is a white wall - cannot move there
- RIGHT (3,3) is a white wall - cannot move there

Continuing UP to get closer to the goal.

Next move: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (2,2). Looking at my options:
- UP (1,2) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- DOWN (3,2) is where I came from
- LEFT (2,1) is a white wall - cannot move there
- RIGHT (2,3) is a white wall - cannot move there

Moving UP to continue toward the goal.

Next move: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (1,2). Checking my options:
- UP (0,2) is a white wall - cannot move there
- DOWN (2,2) is where I came from
- LEFT (1,1) is a white wall - cannot move there
- RIGHT (1,3) is a dark grey path - I can move there

I need to move RIGHT to continue toward the goal at (1,6).

Next move: (1,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (1,3). Looking at my options:
- UP (0,3) is a white wall - cannot move there
- DOWN (2,3) is a white wall - cannot move there
- LEFT (1,2) is where I came from
- RIGHT (1,4) is a dark grey path - I can move there

Continuing RIGHT toward the goal.

Next move: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (1,4). Checking my options:
- UP (0,4) is a white wall - cannot move there
- DOWN (2,4) is a white wall - cannot move there
- LEFT (1,3) is where I came from
- RIGHT (1,5) is a dark grey path - I can move there

Moving RIGHT to get closer to the goal.

Next move: (1,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (1,5) and I can see the goal (RED cell) is directly to my right at (1,6).

Looking at my options:
- UP (0,5) is a white wall - cannot move there
- DOWN (2,5) is a white wall - cannot move there
- LEFT (1,4) is where I came from
- RIGHT (1,6) is the RED goal cell - I can move there!

Next move: (1,6)
