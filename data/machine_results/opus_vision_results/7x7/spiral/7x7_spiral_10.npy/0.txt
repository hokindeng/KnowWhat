# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE cell) is at (5,6)
- The goal (RED cell) is at (1,6)
- I need to navigate through the dark grey path cells to reach the goal

From my current position at (5,6), I can see that:
- Moving UP to (4,6) is blocked by a white wall
- Moving DOWN to (6,6) is blocked by a white wall
- Moving LEFT to (5,5) leads to a dark grey path cell
- Moving RIGHT would be out of bounds

Therefore, my first move is to go LEFT.

Next move: (5,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (5,5). Looking at the maze:
- The goal (RED cell) is at (1,6)
- I need to continue navigating through the dark grey paths

From my current position at (5,5):
- Moving UP to (4,5) is blocked by a white wall
- Moving DOWN to (6,5) is blocked by a white wall
- Moving LEFT to (5,4) leads to a dark grey path cell
- Moving RIGHT to (5,6) would take me back where I came from

I'll continue moving LEFT along the path.

Next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (5,4). From here:
- Moving UP to (4,4) is blocked by a white wall
- Moving DOWN to (6,4) is blocked by a white wall
- Moving LEFT to (5,3) leads to a dark grey path cell
- Moving RIGHT to (5,5) would take me back where I came from

I'll continue moving LEFT along the path.

Next move: (5,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (5,3). From here:
- Moving UP to (4,3) is blocked by a white wall

- Moving DOWN to (4,2) would take me back where I came from
- Moving LEFT to (3,1) is blocked by a white wall
- Moving RIGHT to (3,3) is blocked by a white wall

I'll continue moving UP towards the goal.

Next move: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (2,2). From here:
- Moving UP to (1,2) leads to a dark grey path cell
- Moving DOWN to (3,2) would take me back where I came from
- Moving LEFT to (2,1) is blocked by a white wall
- Moving RIGHT to (2,3) is blocked by a white wall

I'll move UP to get closer to the goal row.

Next move: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Great! I'm now at position (1,2) and I'm on the same row as the goal at (1,6). From here:
- Moving UP to (0,2) is blocked by a white wall
- Moving DOWN to (2,2) would take me back where I came from
- Moving LEFT to (1,1) is blocked by a white wall
- Moving RIGHT to (1,3) leads to a dark grey path cell

I'll move RIGHT along row 1 towards the goal.

- Moving RIGHT to (1,5) leads to a dark grey path cell

I'll continue moving RIGHT towards the goal.

Next move: (1,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at position (1,5) and the goal is right next to me at (1,6). From here:
- Moving UP to (0,5) is blocked by a white wall
- Moving DOWN to (2,5) is blocked by a white wall
- Moving LEFT to (1,4) would take me back where I came from
- Moving RIGHT to (1,6) is the RED goal cell!

Time for the final move to reach the goal!

Next move: (1,6)

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "T" shape. This is evident from the horizontal line of corridors across row 1 (from column 2 to 6) and the vertical line of corridors down column 2 (from row 1 to 5). When viewed together, these corridors create a clear "T" pattern.

Part 2: Here is my new T-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 S 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- I maintained the T-shape with a horizontal corridor in row 1
- The vertical part of the T is shifted one column right compared to the original
- The start position is placed in the junction of the T
- The goal is placed at the end of the horizontal bar
- There is a valid path from S to G
- The overall dimensions remain 7x7
- The fundamental T-shape is preserved while creating a different layout
