# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in five directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or DIAGONAL
2. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
3. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
4. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (4,1)
- The goal (RED): (5,4)
- Available paths (DARK GREY cells)

From my current position at (4,1), I can move to adjacent cells. Let me check which moves are valid:
- UP to (3,1): DARK GREY - valid
- DOWN to (5,1): DARK GREY - valid  
- RIGHT to (4,2): WHITE - blocked
- DIAGONAL UP-RIGHT to (3,2): DARK GREY - valid

I'll move down to get closer to the goal.

Next move: (5,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm now at (5,1). The goal is at (5,4), which is on the same row but I need to move right.

From my current position at (5,1), let me check the available moves:
- UP to (4,1): DARK GREY - valid
- DOWN to (6,1): DARK GREY - valid
- RIGHT to (5,2): WHITE - blocked
- DIAGONAL DOWN-RIGHT to (6,2): DARK GREY - valid

Since I can't move directly right, I'll move down to continue finding a path.

Next move: (6,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (6,1) and need to reach the goal at (5,4). I can see a path along the bottom row.

From my current position at (6,1), checking available moves:
- LEFT to (6,0): WHITE - blocked
- RIGHT to (6,2): DARK GREY - valid
- UP to (5,1): DARK GREY - valid
- DOWN: Out of bounds

I'll move right to continue along the path.

Next move: (6,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good progress! I'm at (6,2) and can see the path continues to the right along the bottom row.

From my current position at (6,2), checking available moves:
- LEFT to (6,1): DARK GREY - valid but backwards
- RIGHT to (6,3): DARK GREY - valid
- UP to (5,2): WHITE - blocked

I'll continue moving right.

Next move: (6,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (6,3) and I can see the goal at (5,4) is diagonally adjacent to my position.

From my current position at (6,3), I can move:
- UP to (5,3): DARK GREY - valid
- RIGHT to (6,4): DARK GREY - valid  
- DIAGONAL UP-RIGHT to (5,4): RED (the goal!) - valid

I can reach the goal with a diagonal move!

Next move: (5,4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "T" shape. This is evident from the vertical line of corridors running from (2,1) to (6,1), which then connects to a horizontal line of corridors along the bottom row from (6,1) to (6,5), forming a clear T-shaped pattern.

Part 2: Here is my new T-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 S 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 1
```

This maze maintains the T-shape pattern but with:
- The vertical line positioned in column 2 instead of column 1
- The start position (S) at the top of the vertical line
- The goal position (G) in the horizontal part of the T
- A valid path exists from S to G
- The overall dimensions remain 7x7
- The basic T-shape structure is preserved while being distinct from the original maze
