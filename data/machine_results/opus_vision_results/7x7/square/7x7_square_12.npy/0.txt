# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE cell): (1,5)
- The goal (RED cell): (6,0)
- I need to find a path through the dark grey cells

From my current position at (1,5), I can move:
- UP to (0,5) - NO, this is a white wall
- DOWN to (2,5) - YES, this is a dark grey path
- LEFT to (1,4) - YES, this is a dark grey path  
- RIGHT to (1,6) - NO, this is a white wall

I can see a path that goes down the right side of the maze (column 5) and then across the bottom row to reach the goal. My first move will be to go down.

Next move: (2,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (2,5). Continuing my path downward through the dark grey cells toward the goal.

From my current position, I can see that:
- UP (1,5) - dark grey but that's where I came from
- DOWN (3,5) - dark grey path (good option)
- LEFT (2,4) - white wall (blocked)
- RIGHT (2,6) - white wall (blocked)

I'll continue moving down along column 5.

Next move: (3,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (3,5). Continuing to move downward through the dark grey path.

From my current position, I can move:
- UP (2,5) - dark grey but that's where I came from
- DOWN (4,5) - dark grey path (continuing downward)
- LEFT (3,4) - white wall (blocked)
- RIGHT (3,6) - white wall (blocked)

I'll continue moving down.

Next move: (4,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (4,5). I need to continue moving down to reach the bottom row where I can then move left toward the goal.

From my current position, I can move:
- UP (3,5) - dark grey but that's where I came from
- DOWN (5,5) - dark grey path (continuing downward)
- LEFT (4,4) - white wall (blocked)
- RIGHT (4,6) - white wall (blocked)

I'll continue moving down.

Next move: (5,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (5,5). I need to move down to reach the bottom row, then I can move left toward the goal.

From my current position, I can move:
- UP (4,5) - dark grey but that's where I came from
- DOWN (6,5) - dark grey path (moving to bottom row)
- LEFT (5,4) - white wall (blocked)
- RIGHT (5,6) - white wall (blocked)

I'll move down to the bottom row.

Next move: (6,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (6,5) on the bottom row. The goal at (6,0) is directly to my left along this same row. I can see a clear path of dark grey cells leading to it.

From my current position, I can move:
- UP (5,5) - dark grey but that's where I came from
- DOWN - not possible, I'm at the bottom edge
- LEFT (6,4) - dark grey path (moving toward the goal)
- RIGHT (6,6) - white wall (blocked)

I'll move left toward the goal.

Next move: (6,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (6,4). I'm on the bottom row and need to continue moving left to reach the goal at (6,0).

From my current position, I can move:
- UP (5,4) - white wall (blocked)
- DOWN - not possible, I'm at the bottom edge
- LEFT (6,3) - dark grey path (continuing toward the goal)
- RIGHT (6,5) - dark grey but that's where I came from

I'll continue moving left.

Next move: (6,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (6,3). I need to continue moving left along the bottom row to reach the goal at (6,0).

From my current position, I can move:
- UP (5,3) - white wall (blocked)
- DOWN - not possible, I'm at the bottom edge
- LEFT (6,2) - dark grey path (continuing toward the goal)
- RIGHT (6,4) - dark grey but that's where I came from

I'll continue moving left.

Next move: (6,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (6,2). I'm getting close to the goal at (6,0)! I need to continue moving left along the bottom row.

From my current position, I can move:
- UP (5,2) - white wall (blocked)
- DOWN - not possible, I'm at the bottom edge
- LEFT (6,1) - dark grey path (continuing toward the goal)
- RIGHT (6,3) - dark grey but that's where I came from

I'll continue moving left.

Next move: (6,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (6,1), and I can see the goal (RED cell) is directly to my left at (6,0)! This is my final move.

From my current position, I can move:
- UP (5,1) - white wall (blocked)
- DOWN - not possible, I'm at the bottom edge
- LEFT (6,0) - RED goal cell (this is it!)
- RIGHT (6,2) - dark grey but that's where I came from

Moving to the goal!

Next move: (6,0)

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an "L" shape. This is evident from the continuous path of dark grey cells that runs along the right side of the maze (the vertical part of the L) and then turns left along the bottom row (the horizontal part of the L).

Part 2: Here is my new L-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 S 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 G 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This maze maintains the L-shape pattern but with some key differences from the original:
1. The starting position (S) is at the top of the vertical corridor
2. The goal position (G) is at the left end of the horizontal corridor
3. The corridors are slightly wider in some places
4. The path from start to goal requires traveling down the vertical section and then left along the horizontal section, maintaining the L-shape but with a different traversal direction from the original

The maze is still solvable and maintains the same basic L-shaped structure while being distinct from the original maze.
