# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (0,2)
- The goal (RED): (3,0)
- I need to navigate through the dark grey paths to reach the goal

From my current position at (0,2), I can move:
- LEFT to (0,1) - which is a dark grey path
- RIGHT to (0,3) - which is a dark grey path
- I cannot move DOWN to (1,2) as it's a white wall
- I cannot move UP as I'm already at the top row

Since the goal is at (3,0) which is to the left and down from my position, I'll start by moving left.

Next move: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (0,1). The goal is at (3,0), so I need to continue moving left and then find a way down.

From my current position at (0,1), I can move:
- LEFT to (0,0) - which is a dark grey path
- RIGHT to (0,2) - back where I came from
- DOWN to (1,1) - blocked by a white wall
- Cannot move UP (already at top)

I'll continue moving left towards the goal column.

Next move: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (0,0). The goal is at (3,0), directly below me. I need to move down to reach it.

From my current position at (0,0), I can move:
- Cannot move LEFT (already at leftmost column)
- RIGHT to (0,1) - back where I came from
- DOWN to (1,0) - which is a dark grey path
- Cannot move UP (already at top row)

I'll move down towards the goal.

Next move: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (1,0). The goal is at (3,0), so I need to continue moving down.

From my current position at (1,0), I can move:
- Cannot move LEFT (already at leftmost column)
- RIGHT to (1,1) - blocked by a white wall
- DOWN to (2,0) - which is a dark grey path
- UP to (0,0) - back where I came from

I'll continue moving down towards the goal.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (2,0). The goal is at (3,0), which is directly below me!

From my current position at (2,0), I can move:
- Cannot move LEFT (already at leftmost column)
- RIGHT to (2,1) - blocked by a white wall
- DOWN to (3,0) - which is the RED goal cell!
- UP to (1,0) - back where I came from

I can reach the goal in one move!

Next move: (3,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a vertical line shape (I-shape). This is evident from the fact that all accessible cells are arranged in a single straight column along the leftmost edge of the maze, from top to bottom, without any branches or turns.

Part 2: Here is my new I-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
S 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
```

This new maze:
- Maintains the I-shape pattern along a single column
- Has different start/goal positions than the original
- Provides a valid path from S to G
- Uses the same 5x5 dimensions
- Is not identical to the original maze but preserves the shape concept
- The path is still vertical but positioned differently than the original

The main difference from the original is that I placed the start position at the top of the I-shape and the goal position near the bottom, with additional accessible corridor space below the goal, while maintaining the fundamental vertical line pattern.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
