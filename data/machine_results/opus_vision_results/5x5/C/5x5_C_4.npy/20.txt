# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- I'm currently at position (4,1) - the BLUE cell
- The goal is at position (0,1) - the RED cell
- There's a large block of WHITE cells (walls) in the middle of the maze

From my current position (4,1), I can move:
- LEFT to (4,0) - which is a DARK GREY cell (valid path)
- RIGHT to (4,2) - which is a DARK GREY cell (valid path)
- UP to (3,1) would be a WHITE cell (wall) - not allowed
- DOWN would be out of bounds

I'll need to navigate around the wall. Let me start by moving left.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I've moved to (4,0). Now I'm at the leftmost column. Looking at the maze:
- The goal is at (0,1) - still the RED cell
- I need to go up and then right to reach it

From my current position (4,0), I can move:
- UP to (3,0) - which is a DARK GREY cell (valid path)
- RIGHT to (4,1) - which is a DARK GREY cell (but I just came from there)
- LEFT and DOWN would be out of bounds

I'll continue moving up.

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at (3,0). I need to continue moving up to get closer to the goal at (0,1).

From my current position (3,0), I can move:
- UP to (2,0) - which is a DARK GREY cell (valid path)
- RIGHT to (3,1) - which is a WHITE cell (wall) - not allowed
- DOWN to (4,0) - which is where I came from
- LEFT would be out of bounds

I'll continue moving up.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm at (2,0) and getting closer to the goal. The goal is still at (0,1).

From my current position (2,0), I can move:
- UP to (1,0) - which is a DARK GREY cell (valid path)
- RIGHT to (2,1) - which is a WHITE cell (wall) - not allowed
- DOWN to (3,0) - which is where I came from
- LEFT would be out of bounds

I'll continue moving up.

Next move: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Great! I'm at (1,0) and very close to the goal now. The goal is at (0,1) - just one row up and one column to the right.

From my current position (1,0), I can move:
- UP to (0,0) - which is a DARK GREY cell (valid path)
- RIGHT to (1,1) - which is a WHITE cell (wall) - not allowed
- DOWN to (2,0) - which is where I came from
- LEFT would be out of bounds

I'll move up to get to the top row.

Next move: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (0,0) and the goal is right next to me at (0,1)! 

From my current position (0,0), I can move:
- RIGHT to (0,1) - which is the RED cell (the GOAL!)
- DOWN to (1,0) - which is where I came from
- UP and LEFT would be out of bounds

I'll move right to reach the goal!

Next move: (0,1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an "L" shape. This is evident from the continuous path of non-wall cells that starts at the bottom, goes up the leftmost column, and then makes a right turn at the top to reach the goal, creating a clear "L" pattern. The dark grey and colored cells together form this L-shaped corridor.

Part 2: Here is my new L-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
G 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
S 0 0 0 1
```

This maze:
- Maintains the L-shape corridor pattern
- Has different start (S) and goal (G) positions than the original
- Provides a valid path from start to goal
- Uses the same 5x5 dimensions
- Creates the L-shape using a different layout while keeping the same basic shape concept
- Has a valid solution (player can move up from bottom-left corner to reach the goal)

The main difference from the original is that this version has the horizontal part of the L at the bottom rather than the top, and the goal is at the top rather than in the middle, while still maintaining the fundamental L-shaped corridor pattern.
