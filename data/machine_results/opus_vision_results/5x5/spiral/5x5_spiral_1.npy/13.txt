# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (0,4)
- The goal (RED): (2,1)
- There's a wall of WHITE cells blocking row 1 from columns 0-3

From my current position at (0,4), I can move:
- DOWN to (1,4) - which is a DARK GREY path cell
- LEFT to (0,3) - which is also a DARK GREY path cell

To reach the goal at (2,1), I'll need to navigate around the wall. The most direct path appears to be going down first.

Next move: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm now at (1,4). Looking at the available moves:
- UP to (0,4) - that's where I came from
- DOWN to (2,4) - DARK GREY path cell
- LEFT to (1,3) - WHITE wall, can't go there
- RIGHT - out of bounds

I need to continue down to get around the wall and then move left towards the goal.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at (2,4), which is on the same row as the goal at (2,1). However, I can see there's a WHITE wall at (2,3) blocking the direct path. 

Looking at my options:
- UP to (1,4) - DARK GREY path
- DOWN to (3,4) - DARK GREY path
- LEFT to (2,3) - WHITE wall, blocked
- RIGHT - out of bounds

I need to go down to find an alternate route.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (3,4). I can see the wall continues at (3,3), blocking my path left. 

Looking at my options:
- UP to (2,4) - where I came from
- DOWN to (4,4) - DARK GREY path
- LEFT to (3,3) - WHITE wall, blocked
- RIGHT - out of bounds

I need to continue moving down to find a way around the walls.

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (4,4), the bottom-right corner. I can see the entire bottom row consists of DARK GREY path cells, which means I can move left along this row.

Looking at my options:
- UP to (3,4) - where I came from
- DOWN - out of bounds
- LEFT to (4,3) - DARK GREY path
- RIGHT - out of bounds

I'll start moving left along the bottom row.

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,3). I can see the wall continues at (3,3) above me. I need to keep moving left along the bottom row to find a path upward.

Looking at my options:
- UP to (3,3) - WHITE wall, blocked
- DOWN - out of bounds
- LEFT to (4,2) - DARK GREY path
- RIGHT to (4,4) - where I came from

I'll continue moving left.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Great! I'm at (4,2) and I can see that (3,2) above me is a DARK GREY path cell, not a wall! This is my chance to move up.

Looking at my options:
- UP to (3,2) - DARK GREY path
- DOWN - out of bounds
- LEFT to (4,1) - DARK GREY path
- RIGHT to (4,3) - where I came from

I'll move up to get closer to the goal.

Next move: (3,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an inverted "L" shape (or backwards "7" shape). This is evident from the continuous path of non-wall cells that runs along the top row, then down the rightmost column, and finally across the bottom row.

Part 2: Here is my new inverted "L"-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
0 0 0 0 S
1 1 1 1 0
1 G 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

This maze:
- Maintains the inverted "L" shape of accessible cells
- Has different start/goal positions than the original
- Provides a valid path from start to goal
- Uses walls to block certain sections while maintaining the shape
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions as the original
- The path requires navigation around obstacles while staying within the inverted "L" pattern

The main difference from the original is that this version has the long horizontal corridor at the top rather than bottom, and the vertical segment on the right side remains consistent with the inverted "L" shape. The goal is placed in a challenging but reachable position that requires careful navigation through the shape.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
