# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (0,4)
- The goal (RED): (2,1)
- WHITE cells (walls) form barriers in rows 1 and 3
- DARK GREY cells are the paths I can move through

From my current position at (0,4), I can move:
- DOWN to (1,4) - which is a dark grey path cell
- LEFT to (0,3) - which is also a dark grey path cell

I'll start by moving down to get around the wall in row 1.

Next move: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I've moved to (1,4). Now I need to find a path to reach the goal at (2,1).

From my current position at (1,4), I can see:
- UP to (0,4) - dark grey (but that's where I came from)
- DOWN to (2,4) - dark grey path
- LEFT to (1,3) - WHITE wall (cannot move there)
- RIGHT - out of bounds

I'll continue moving down to get to row 2 where the goal is located.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at (2,4) on the same row as the goal at (2,1). However, I can see there's a WHITE wall at (2,3) blocking the direct path.

From my current position at (2,4), I need to find an alternate route. I can:
- UP to (1,4) - dark grey (but that's backtracking)
- DOWN to (3,4) - dark grey path
- LEFT to (2,3) - WHITE wall (cannot move there)

I'll move down to continue finding a path around the obstacles.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (3,4). Looking at row 3, I can see it's completely blocked by WHITE walls from (3,0) to (3,3), so I cannot move left directly.

From my current position at (3,4), I can:
- UP to (2,4) - dark grey (but that's backtracking)
- DOWN to (4,4) - dark grey path
- LEFT to (3,3) - WHITE wall (cannot move there)

I need to continue down to row 4 to find a way around this wall.

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good! I'm now at (4,4) in the bottom row. I can see that the entire row 4 consists of dark grey cells, which means I can move left freely along this row.

From my current position at (4,4), I can:
- UP to (3,4) - dark grey (but that's backtracking)
- DOWN - out of bounds
- LEFT to (4,3) - dark grey path

I'll move left along the bottom row to find a path upward.

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (4,3). Looking up, I can see (3,3) is a WHITE wall, so I cannot move up from here. I need to continue moving left along row 4 to find a clear path upward.

From my current position at (4,3), I can:
- UP to (3,3) - WHITE wall (cannot move there)
- LEFT to (4,2) - dark grey path
- RIGHT to (4,4) - dark grey (but that's backtracking)

I'll continue moving left.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,2). Looking up, I can see (3,2) is a WHITE wall, so I still cannot move up here. I need to continue moving left.

From my current position at (4,2), I can:
- UP to (3,2) - WHITE wall (cannot move there)
- LEFT to (4,1) - dark grey path
- RIGHT to (4,3) - dark grey (but that's backtracking)

I'll continue moving left.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,1). Looking up, I can see (3,1) is a WHITE wall, so I still cannot move up directly to reach the goal at (2,1). I need to continue moving left.

From my current position at (4,1), I can:
- UP to (3,1) - WHITE wall (cannot move there)
- LEFT to (4,0) - dark grey path
- RIGHT to (4,2) - dark grey (but that's backtracking)

I'll move left to continue searching for a path upward.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,0), the leftmost position in the bottom row. Looking up, I see (3,0) is a WHITE wall, so I cannot move up from here either. 

I need to backtrack and find a column where I can move upward. Looking at the maze, I notice that (2,0) is a dark grey cell that's adjacent to my goal at (2,1), but I can't reach it directly from here due to the wall at (3,0).

Let me move back to the right to find a path upward.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (4,1). Looking at the maze more carefully, I notice that (3,4) appears to be a dark grey cell - it's the only cell in row 3 that isn't a white wall!

From my current position, I need to move right to reach column 4 where I can move upward.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,2). I need to continue moving right to reach column 4, where I can move upward through (3,4) which is the only dark grey cell in row 3.

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,3). Looking up, I see (3,3) is a WHITE wall. I need to continue moving right to reach column 4 where I can move upward.

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm back at (4,4). Now I can see that (3,4) above me is a dark grey cell - it's the only passable cell in row 3. I can move up through it.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm at (3,4) and have successfully navigated through the wall barrier in row 3. Looking up, I can see (2,4) is a dark grey cell, so I can continue moving upward.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm back at (2,4) on the same row as the goal at (2,1). However, I can see that (2,3) is a WHITE wall blocking the direct path. I need to find an alternate route.

Looking up, I can see (1,4) is a dark grey cell. I'll move up to row 1 to find a path around the obstacle.

Next move: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (1,4). Looking at row 1, I can see most of it is blocked by WHITE walls from (1,1) to (1,3). To reach the goal at (2,1), I need to go through row 0.

I can see (0,4) above me is a dark grey cell. I'll move up to the top row.

Next move: (0,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an inverted "L" shape (or rotated "âŒž" shape). This is evident from how the non-wall cells create a path that runs along the bottom row (from column 0 to 4) and then extends upward along the rightmost column (from row 4 to 0), forming a 90-degree angle.

Part 2: Here is my new inverted "L"-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
0 1 1 1 S
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

This maze:
- Maintains the inverted "L" shape with corridors along the bottom row and right column
- Has a valid path from start (S) to goal (G)
- Uses a different layout than the original while keeping the same shape pattern
- Maintains the 5x5 dimensions
- Places walls (1) and corridors (0) to create the inverted "L" pattern
- Includes start (S) and goal (G) positions that are connected via the corridor pattern

The path from S to G requires navigating down the right column and then left through the bottom row, maintaining the inverted "L" shape concept but with a different specific implementation than the original maze.
