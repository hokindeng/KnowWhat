# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (0,4)
- The goal (RED): (2,1)
- I need to find a path through the dark grey cells

From my current position at (0,4), I can move:
- DOWN to (1,4) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (0,3) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)

I can see that there's a large block of white walls in the middle of the maze. To reach the goal at (2,1), I'll need to navigate around these walls. Looking at the path structure, I believe I should go down and then work my way around through the bottom portion of the maze.

Next move: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm now at position (1,4). I need to continue navigating around the white walls to reach the goal at (2,1).

From my current position at (1,4), I can move:
- UP to (0,4) - where I came from
- DOWN to (2,4) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (1,3) - this is a white cell (blocked)

I'll continue moving down to work my way around the walls.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (2,4), which is on the same row as the goal at (2,1)! However, I can see that (2,3) is a white wall blocking the direct path.

From my current position at (2,4), I can move:
- UP to (1,4) - where I came from
- DOWN to (3,4) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (2,3) - this is a white cell (blocked)

I need to continue finding a path around the walls. I'll move down to continue exploring.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (3,4). I need to find a path around the white walls to reach the goal at (2,1).

From my current position at (3,4), I can move:
- UP to (2,4) - where I came from
- DOWN to (4,4) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- LEFT to (3,3) - this is a white cell (blocked)

I can see that row 4 has several dark grey cells forming a path. I'll move down to explore this route.

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (4,4). I can see the bottom row has a clear path of dark grey cells that I can follow.

From my current position at (4,4), I can move:
- UP to (3,4) - where I came from
- LEFT to (4,3) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)

I'll move left to continue along the bottom path.

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (4,3). I can continue moving left along the bottom row through the dark grey cells.

From my current position at (4,3), I can move:
- UP to (3,3) - this is a white cell (blocked)
- LEFT to (4,2) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- RIGHT to (4,4) - where I came from

I'll continue moving left.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (4,2). I'm making progress toward the left side of the maze where I need to find a path up to the goal at (2,1).

From my current position at (4,2), I can move:
- UP to (3,2) - this is a white cell (blocked)
- LEFT to (4,1) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- RIGHT to (4,3) - where I came from

I'll continue moving left.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (4,1). I'm in the same column as the goal at (2,1)! However, I need to check if I can move up from here.

From my current position at (4,1), I can move:
- UP to (3,1) - this is a white cell (blocked)
- LEFT to (4,0) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- RIGHT to (4,2) - where I came from

Since the direct path up is blocked, I'll continue exploring by moving left.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (4,0). I'm at the leftmost column of the maze and need to find a path upward to reach the goal at (2,1).

From my current position at (4,0), I can move:
- UP to (3,0) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- RIGHT to (4,1) - where I came from

I'll move up to explore the path along the left edge.

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (3,0). I'm getting closer to the goal! I can see that I'm just one row below row 2 where the goal is located.

From my current position at (3,0), I can move:
- UP to (2,0) - this is a dark grey cell (valid move)
- DOWN to (4,0) - where I came from
- RIGHT to (3,1) - this is a white cell (blocked)

I'll move up to get to the same row as the goal.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm now at position (2,0), on the same row as the goal! The red goal cell is directly to my right at (2,1).

From my current position at (2,0), I can move:
- RIGHT to (2,1) - this is the RED cell (the goal!)
- DOWN to (3,0) - where I came from
- UP to (1,0) - this is a white cell (blocked)

I'll move right to reach the goal!

Next move: (2,1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an inverted "L" shape (or backwards "L" shape). This is evident from how the non-wall cells create a path that runs along the bottom row and then turns upward along the leftmost column, forming a 90-degree angle characteristic of an "L" shape, but inverted from its typical orientation.

Part 2: Here is my new inverted "L"-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
0 0 1 1 S
1 1 1 1 0
G 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

This maze:
- Maintains the inverted "L" shape pattern of corridors
- Has different start/goal positions than the original
- Provides a valid path from S to G
- Uses the same 5x5 dimensions
- Creates the "L" shape using the bottom row and rightmost column instead of the left column
- Includes some additional corridor spaces within the shape while maintaining the overall pattern

The path from S to G is possible by following the corridors, and the shape is still recognizable as an inverted "L", just mirrored from the original maze's orientation.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
