# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (0,4)
- The goal (RED): (2,1)
- There's a wall barrier across most of row 1

From my current position at (0,4), I can move:
- DOWN to (1,4) - which is a dark grey path cell
- LEFT to (0,3) - which is also a dark grey path cell

Since I need to get to (2,1) and there's a wall barrier at row 1, I'll need to go down through the only opening at (1,4) to eventually reach the goal.

Next move: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm now at (1,4). Looking at the maze:
- My current position (BLUE): (1,4)
- The goal (RED): (2,1)
- I need to continue navigating around the wall barrier

From (1,4), I can see that:
- UP (0,4) is where I came from
- LEFT (1,3) is a WHITE wall - cannot move there
- DOWN (2,4) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- RIGHT would be out of bounds

I need to go down to continue my path toward the goal.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at (2,4). Looking at the maze:
- My current position (BLUE): (2,4)
- The goal (RED): (2,1)
- I'm on the same row as the goal, but there's a wall at (2,3) blocking direct access

From (2,4), I can move:
- UP (1,4) is where I came from
- DOWN (3,4) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- LEFT (2,3) is a WHITE wall - cannot move there
- RIGHT would be out of bounds

Since I can't move directly left due to the wall, I need to go down to find another path.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm at (3,4). Looking at the maze:
- My current position (BLUE): (3,4)
- The goal (RED): (2,1)
- I need to find a path that allows me to go left toward the goal

From (3,4), I can move:
- UP (2,4) is where I came from
- DOWN (4,4) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- LEFT (3,3) is a WHITE wall - cannot move there
- RIGHT would be out of bounds

I need to continue down to find an open path to move left.

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent, I'm at (4,4) - the bottom-right corner. Looking at the maze:
- My current position (BLUE): (4,4)
- The goal (RED): (2,1)
- Row 4 appears to be entirely dark grey paths, so I can move left along it

From (4,4), I can move:
- UP (3,4) is where I came from
- LEFT (4,3) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- DOWN and RIGHT would be out of bounds

I'll start moving left along the bottom row.

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm at (4,3). Looking at the maze:
- My current position (BLUE): (4,3)
- The goal (RED): (2,1)
- I need to continue moving left along the bottom row

From (4,3), I can move:
- UP (3,3) is a WHITE wall - cannot move there
- RIGHT (4,4) is where I came from
- LEFT (4,2) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- DOWN would be out of bounds

I'll continue moving left.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect, I'm at (4,2). Looking at the maze:
- My current position (BLUE): (4,2)
- The goal (RED): (2,1)
- I'm directly below the goal's column

From (4,2), I can move:
- UP (3,2) is a WHITE wall - cannot move there
- RIGHT (4,3) is where I came from
- LEFT (4,1) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- DOWN would be out of bounds

I'll continue moving left to position myself under the goal.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm at (4,1) - directly below the goal. Looking at the maze:
- My current position (BLUE): (4,1)
- The goal (RED): (2,1)
- I need to move up, but (3,1) appears to be a WHITE wall

From (4,1), I can move:
- UP (3,1) is a WHITE wall - cannot move there
- RIGHT (4,2) is where I came from
- LEFT (4,0) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- DOWN would be out of bounds

Since I can't go directly up, I'll move left to find another path.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm at (4,0) - the bottom-left corner. Looking at the maze:
- My current position (BLUE): (4,0)
- The goal (RED): (2,1)
- I need to find a path up the left side

From (4,0), I can move:
- UP (3,0) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- RIGHT (4,1) is where I came from
- LEFT and DOWN would be out of bounds

I'll move up along the left edge.

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (3,0). Looking at the maze:
- My current position (BLUE): (3,0)
- The goal (RED): (2,1)
- I'm getting closer to the goal

From (3,0), I can move:
- UP (2,0) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- RIGHT (3,1) is a WHITE wall - cannot move there
- DOWN (4,0) is where I came from
- LEFT would be out of bounds

I'll continue moving up.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm at (2,0) - right next to the goal! Looking at the maze:
- My current position (BLUE): (2,0)
- The goal (RED): (2,1) - directly to my right!

From (2,0), I can move:
- UP (1,0) is a WHITE wall - cannot move there
- RIGHT (2,1) is the RED GOAL - I can move there!
- DOWN (3,0) is where I came from
- LEFT would be out of bounds

I can reach the goal with one more move!

Next move: (2,1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an inverted "T" shape. This is evident from how the non-wall cells create a vertical line down the right side of the maze that connects to a horizontal line at the bottom, forming a "T" that's rotated 180 degrees. The corridors allow movement along the top row, down the rightmost column, and across the bottom row.

Part 2: Here is my new inverted T-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
0 0 0 0 S
1 1 1 0 0
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1
```

This maze:
- Maintains the inverted T shape of connected corridors
- Has different start/goal positions while keeping the shape pattern
- Provides a valid solution path
- Uses a different layout than the original
- Maintains the 5x5 dimensions
- The inverted T is still formed by the corridors, but with a different arrangement of walls and open spaces

The path from S to G remains solvable, requiring navigation through the inverted T shape corridors, but in a different pattern than the original maze.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
