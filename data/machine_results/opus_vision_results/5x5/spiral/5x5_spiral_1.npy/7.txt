# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (0,4)
- The goal (RED): (2,1)
- I need to find a path through the dark grey cells

From my current position (0,4), I can move:
- DOWN to (1,4) - which is a dark grey path cell
- LEFT to (0,3) - which is a dark grey path cell

I'll start by moving down to explore that direction.

Next move: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm now at (1,4). I need to reach the goal at (2,1).

From my current position (1,4), I can move:
- UP to (0,4) - but that's where I came from
- DOWN to (2,4) - which is a dark grey path cell
- LEFT to (1,3) - which is a white wall (cannot move there)

I'll continue moving down.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (2,4) and the goal is at (2,1). I'm on the same row as the goal, but I can see there's a white wall at (2,3) blocking the direct path.

From my current position (2,4), I can move:
- UP to (1,4) - back where I came from
- DOWN to (3,4) - which is a dark grey path cell
- LEFT to (2,3) - which is a white wall (cannot move there)

I'll continue down to find an alternative route.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (3,4). Looking at the maze, I need to find a way to reach the goal at (2,1).

From my current position (3,4), I can move:
- UP to (2,4) - where I came from
- DOWN to (4,4) - which is a dark grey path cell
- LEFT to (3,3) - which is a white wall (cannot move there)

I'll continue exploring by moving down.

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (4,4). I need to find a path to the goal at (2,1).

From my current position (4,4), I can move:
- UP to (3,4) - where I came from
- LEFT to (4,3) - which is a dark grey path cell

I'll move left to explore a new route.

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (4,3). I need to continue exploring to find a path to the goal at (2,1).

From my current position (4,3), I can move:
- UP to (3,3) - which is a white wall (cannot move there)
- LEFT to (4,2) - which is a dark grey path cell
- RIGHT to (4,4) - where I came from

I'll continue moving left.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (4,2). The goal is at (2,1), so I need to continue moving left and then find a way up.

From my current position (4,2), I can move:
- UP to (3,2) - which is a white wall (cannot move there)
- LEFT to (4,1) - which is a dark grey path cell
- RIGHT to (4,3) - where I came from

I'll continue moving left.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at (4,1) and the goal is at (2,1) - we're in the same column! I need to move up to reach the goal.

From my current position (4,1), I can move:
- UP to (3,1) - which is a white wall (cannot move there)
- LEFT to (4,0) - which is a dark grey path cell
- RIGHT to (4,2) - where I came from

Since I can't go directly up, I'll move left to continue exploring.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (4,0). I need to move up to eventually reach the goal at (2,1).

From my current position (4,0), I can move:
- UP to (3,0) - which is a dark grey path cell
- RIGHT to (4,1) - where I came from

I'll move up.

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,0) and getting closer to the goal at (2,1).

From my current position (3,0), I can move:
- UP to (2,0) - which is a dark grey path cell
- DOWN to (4,0) - where I came from
- RIGHT to (3,1) - which is a white wall (cannot move there)

I'll continue moving up.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm at (2,0) and the goal is right next to me at (2,1)!

From my current position (2,0), I can move:
- RIGHT to (2,1) - which is the RED goal cell!

Next move: (2,1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an inverted "L" shape (or backwards "7" shape). This is evident from the continuous path of non-wall cells that starts at the top right, goes down the rightmost column, then turns left along the bottom row, creating a perpendicular angle characteristic of an "L" shape.

Part 2: Here is my new inverted "L"-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
0 1 1 1 S
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

This maze:
- Maintains the inverted "L" shape pattern of corridors
- Has different start (S) and goal (G) positions than the original
- Provides a valid path from S to G
- Uses the same 5x5 dimensions
- Creates a different layout while keeping the same basic shape
- The non-wall cells still form an inverted "L" that goes down and then left

The path from S to G requires navigating down the right side and then through the bottom portion of the "L", similar to but distinct from the original maze's solution pattern.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
