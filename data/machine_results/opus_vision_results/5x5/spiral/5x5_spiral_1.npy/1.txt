# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- I'm currently at position (0,4) - the BLUE cell
- The goal is at position (2,1) - the RED cell
- I need to navigate through the DARK GREY cells to reach it

From my current position (0,4), I can move:
- DOWN to (1,4) - which is a dark grey cell (valid path)
- LEFT to (0,3) - which is a dark grey cell (valid path)

I cannot move UP or RIGHT as those would be out of bounds.

Looking at the overall maze structure, I'll start by moving down to explore the path.

Next move: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm now at position (1,4). Looking at the maze:
- The goal is at (2,1) - the RED cell
- From my current position (1,4), I can move:
  - UP to (0,4) - dark grey (where I came from)
  - DOWN to (2,4) - dark grey cell
  - LEFT to (1,3) - white cell (wall - cannot move)
  - RIGHT would be out of bounds

I need to continue exploring downward to find a path to the goal.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at position (2,4), which is on the same row as the goal at (2,1). However, I can see there's a wall at (2,3) blocking the direct path.

From my current position (2,4), I can move:
- UP to (1,4) - dark grey (backtrack)
- DOWN to (3,4) - dark grey cell  
- LEFT to (2,3) - white cell (wall - blocked)
- RIGHT would be out of bounds

I'll continue exploring by moving down to see if I can find an alternate path.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (3,4). Looking at my options:
- UP to (2,4) - dark grey (backtrack)
- DOWN to (4,4) - dark grey cell
- LEFT to (3,3) - white cell (wall - blocked)
- RIGHT would be out of bounds

I'll continue moving down to explore the bottom row.

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (4,4) - the bottom right corner. Looking at my options:
- UP to (3,4) - dark grey (where I came from)
- DOWN would be out of bounds
- LEFT to (4,3) - dark grey cell
- RIGHT would be out of bounds

I need to move left along the bottom row to find a path to the goal.

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (4,3). Checking my options:
- UP to (3,3) - white cell (wall - blocked)
- DOWN would be out of bounds
- LEFT to (4,2) - dark grey cell
- RIGHT to (4,4) - dark grey (where I came from)

Continuing left along the bottom row.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (4,2). Looking at my options:
- UP to (3,2) - white cell (wall - blocked)
- DOWN would be out of bounds
- LEFT to (4,1) - dark grey cell
- RIGHT to (4,3) - dark grey (where I came from)

Continuing to move left along the bottom row.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (4,1). Checking my options:
- UP to (3,1) - white cell (wall - blocked)
- DOWN would be out of bounds
- LEFT to (4,0) - dark grey cell
- RIGHT to (4,2) - dark grey (where I came from)

Continuing to move left.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (4,0) - the bottom left corner. Checking my options:
- UP to (3,0) - dark grey cell
- DOWN would be out of bounds
- LEFT would be out of bounds
- RIGHT to (4,1) - dark grey (where I came from)

Now I'll start moving up to find a path to the goal.

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (3,0). Checking my options:
- UP to (2,0) - dark grey cell
- DOWN to (4,0) - dark grey (where I came from)
- LEFT would be out of bounds
- RIGHT to (3,1) - white cell (wall - blocked)

Continuing to move up to explore the path.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm now at position (2,0), and I can see the goal (RED cell) is right next to me at (2,1).

From my current position (2,0), I can move:
- UP to (1,0) - white cell (wall - blocked)
- DOWN to (3,0) - dark grey (where I came from)
- LEFT would be out of bounds
- RIGHT to (2,1) - RED cell (THE GOAL!)

I can reach the goal with my next move!

Next move: (2,1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an "L" shape. This is evident from the continuous path of dark grey and colored cells that starts at the top right, goes down the rightmost column, then turns left and continues along the bottom row, forming a clear "L" pattern when viewed as a whole.

Part 2: Here is my new L-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
0 1 1 1 S
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 G 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

This maze:
- Maintains the L-shape corridor pattern
- Has different start/goal positions than the original
- Provides a valid path from S to G
- Uses the same 5x5 dimensions
- Creates the L-shape using a different layout while keeping the fundamental L pattern
- The path requires navigating down the right side and then across the bottom, maintaining the L-shaped movement pattern
