# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- I'm currently at position (0,4) - the BLUE cell
- The goal is at position (2,1) - the RED cell
- I need to find a path through the DARK GREY cells

From my current position (0,4), I can move:
- DOWN to (1,4) - which is a dark grey cell
- LEFT to (0,3) - which is a dark grey cell

I cannot move UP (out of bounds) or RIGHT (out of bounds).

Since I need to reach row 2 where the goal is located, and I can see that row 1 has walls (white cells) blocking most paths except at column 4, I'll move down through the opening.

Next move: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I've moved to (1,4). Now I need to continue finding a path to the goal at (2,1).

From my current position (1,4), I can see:
- UP to (0,4) - dark grey cell (where I came from)
- DOWN to (2,4) - dark grey cell
- LEFT to (1,3) - white cell (wall, can't go there)
- RIGHT - out of bounds

I need to go down to row 2 where the goal is located, so I'll move down.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at (2,4) and on the same row as the goal at (2,1). Now I need to move left to reach it.

From my current position (2,4), I can see:
- UP to (1,4) - dark grey cell (where I came from)
- DOWN to (3,4) - dark grey cell
- LEFT to (2,3) - white cell (wall, can't go there)
- RIGHT - out of bounds

Since (2,3) is a wall, I can't move directly left. I need to go down to find another path.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm at (3,4). I need to find a way to move left towards the goal at (2,1).

From my current position (3,4), I can see:
- UP to (2,4) - dark grey cell (where I came from)
- DOWN to (4,4) - dark grey cell
- LEFT to (3,3) - white cell (wall, can't go there)
- RIGHT - out of bounds

Since (3,3) is also a wall, I need to continue down to row 4 to find a path.

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (4,4), the bottom right corner. I can see that row 4 has a path of dark grey cells going left.

From my current position (4,4), I can see:
- UP to (3,4) - dark grey cell (where I came from)
- DOWN - out of bounds
- LEFT to (4,3) - dark grey cell
- RIGHT - out of bounds

I can move left along row 4!

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm at (4,3). I can continue moving left along the bottom row.

From my current position (4,3), I can see:
- UP to (3,3) - white cell (wall, can't go there)
- DOWN - out of bounds
- LEFT to (4,2) - dark grey cell
- RIGHT to (4,4) - dark grey cell (where I came from)

I'll continue left along the bottom row.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,2). Let me continue moving left along the bottom row.

From my current position (4,2), I can see:
- UP to (3,2) - white cell (wall, can't go there)
- DOWN - out of bounds
- LEFT to (4,1) - dark grey cell
- RIGHT to (4,3) - dark grey cell (where I came from)

I'll continue left.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,1). The goal at (2,1) is directly above me, but I need to check the path.

From my current position (4,1), I can see:
- UP to (3,1) - white cell (wall, can't go there)
- DOWN - out of bounds
- LEFT to (4,0) - dark grey cell
- RIGHT to (4,2) - dark grey cell (where I came from)

Since I can't go directly up due to the wall, I'll go left to continue exploring.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,0), the bottom left corner. I need to find a way up to reach the goal at (2,1).

From my current position (4,0), I can see:
- UP to (3,0) - dark grey cell
- DOWN - out of bounds
- LEFT - out of bounds
- RIGHT to (4,1) - dark grey cell (where I came from)

I can move up!

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Great! I'm at (3,0) and I can move up to get closer to the goal.

From my current position (3,0), I can see:
- UP to (2,0) - dark grey cell
- DOWN to (4,0) - dark grey cell (where I came from)
- LEFT - out of bounds
- RIGHT to (3,1) - white cell (wall)

Moving up will put me on the same row as the goal!

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (2,0) and the goal is right next to me at (2,1)!

From my current position (2,0), I can see:
- UP to (1,0) - white cell (wall)
- DOWN to (3,0) - dark grey cell (where I came from)
- LEFT - out of bounds
- RIGHT to (2,1) - RED cell (the goal!)

I can move directly to the goal!

Next move: (2,1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an inverted "T" shape. This is evident from the way the non-wall cells create a vertical line down the rightmost column from (0,4) to (4,4), and then a horizontal line across the bottom row from (4,0) to (4,4), with an additional corridor at (2,0) to (2,2).

Part 2: Here is my new inverted "T"-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
0 1 1 1 S
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

This maze maintains the inverted "T" shape by having:
- A vertical corridor down the rightmost column
- A horizontal corridor across the bottom row
- An additional path branching from the vertical line to reach the goal
- The start (S) and goal (G) positions are in different locations than the original
- A valid path exists from start to goal
- The overall shape pattern is preserved while creating a different layout
