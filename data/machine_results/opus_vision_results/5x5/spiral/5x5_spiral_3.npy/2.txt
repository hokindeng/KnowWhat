# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- I'm currently at position (0,3) - the BLUE cell
- The goal is at position (2,3) - the RED cell
- There's a wall directly below me at (1,3), so I can't go straight down

I need to find an alternative path around the walls. Looking at my available moves from (0,3):
- UP: Can't go up (already at top row)
- DOWN: (1,3) is a WHITE wall - blocked
- LEFT: (0,2) is a DARK GREY path - available
- RIGHT: (0,4) is a DARK GREY path - available

Since I need to navigate around the walls to reach the goal, I'll start by moving left.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (0,2). Looking at my available moves:
- UP: Can't go up (already at top row)
- DOWN: (1,2) is a WHITE wall - blocked
- LEFT: (0,1) is a DARK GREY path - available
- RIGHT: (0,3) is where I just came from

Since I can't go down directly, I'll continue moving left to explore alternative paths.

Next move: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (0,1). Looking at my available moves:
- UP: Can't go up (already at top row)
- DOWN: (1,1) is a WHITE wall - blocked
- LEFT: (0,0) is a DARK GREY path - available
- RIGHT: (0,2) is where I just came from

Going left to (0,0) would lead to a dead end. I need to backtrack and try a different path. Let me go back to (0,2).

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at position (0,2). Since the left path leads to a dead end, let me go back to (0,3) and then try the right path.

Next move: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (0,3). Since the left path didn't work, let me try going right.

Next move: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (0,4). Looking at my available moves:
- UP: Can't go up (already at top row)
- DOWN: (1,4) is a WHITE wall - blocked
- LEFT: (0,3) is where I just came from
- RIGHT: Can't go right (already at rightmost column)

This is also a dead end. I need to go back and find another route. Looking at the maze, I notice that row 1 has walls blocking most paths, but (1,0) appears to be a path. Let me backtrack to find a way to get there.

Next move: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (0,3). Looking at the maze structure, I need to find a path around the walls. I notice that (1,0) is a path cell, and I can potentially route through the bottom of the maze. Let me go left to start working my way there.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,2). To reach the goal at (2,3), I need to find a path around the walls in row 1. I can see that (1,0) is a path, so I'll head left toward it.

Next move: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,1). I'll continue left to (0,0) to find a path downward.

Next move: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,0). Now I can see that (1,0) below me is a DARK GREY path cell, so I can move down!

Next move: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (1,0). Looking at my available moves:
- UP: (0,0) is where I just came from
- DOWN: (2,0) is a DARK GREY path - available
- LEFT: Can't go left (already at leftmost column)
- RIGHT: (1,1) is a WHITE wall - blocked

I'll continue down to explore the path.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (2,0). Looking at my available moves:
- UP: (1,0) is where I just came from
- DOWN: (3,0) is a DARK GREY path - available
- LEFT: Can't go left (already at leftmost column)
- RIGHT: (2,1) is a WHITE wall - blocked

I'll continue down to explore further.

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,0). Looking at my available moves:
- UP: (2,0) is where I just came from
- DOWN: (4,0) is a DARK GREY path - available
- LEFT: Can't go left (already at leftmost column)
- RIGHT: (3,1) is a WHITE wall - blocked

I'll continue down to the bottom row to find a path that leads right toward the goal.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,0). Looking at my available moves:
- UP: (3,0) is where I just came from
- DOWN: Can't go down (already at bottom row)
- LEFT: Can't go left (already at leftmost column)
- RIGHT: (4,1) is a DARK GREY path - available

Perfect! I can now move right along the bottom row.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,1). Looking at my available moves:
- UP: (3,1) is a WHITE wall - blocked
- DOWN: Can't go down (already at bottom row)
- LEFT: (4,0) is where I just came from
- RIGHT: (4,2) is a DARK GREY path - available

I'll continue right along the bottom row.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,2). Looking at my available moves:
- UP: (3,2) is a DARK GREY path - available
- DOWN: Can't go down (already at bottom row)
- LEFT: (4,1) is where I just came from
- RIGHT: (4,3) is a DARK GREY path - available

I need to reach the goal at (2,3). Since I need to go up eventually, I'll move up now.

Next move: (3,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an "L" shape. This is evident from the way the non-wall cells create a path that starts at the top row, goes down the leftmost column, and then turns right along the bottom row. The corridors essentially trace an "L" pattern within the 5x5 grid.

Part 2: Here is my new L-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
S 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
0 0 G 1 1
```

This maze:
- Maintains the L-shape pattern of corridors
- Has different start/goal positions than the original
- Provides a valid path from S to G
- Uses the same 5x5 dimensions
- Creates the L-shape by having corridors along the top row and right side
- Is not identical to the original maze while keeping the same general shape pattern

The path from S to G is valid and follows the L-shaped corridor pattern, but the specific implementation is different from the original maze.
