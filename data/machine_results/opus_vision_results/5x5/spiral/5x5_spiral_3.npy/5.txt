# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (0,3)
- The goal (RED): (2,3)
- There's a wall directly below me at (1,3)

I need to find an alternate path. I can see that I can go around the wall by moving right first.

Next move: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at the current state:
- I'm at (0,4)
- The goal is at (2,3)
- Below me at (1,4) is a wall

I need to find another path. I'll start by going left along the top row to find a way down.

Next move: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position (0,3) and the goal at (2,3):
- Below me at (1,3) is a wall
- I need to find an alternate path

I'll move left to explore another route.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position (0,2):
- Below me at (1,2) is a wall
- I need to find another path to reach the goal at (2,3)

I'll continue moving left to explore alternative routes.

Next move: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position (0,1):
- Below me at (1,1) is a wall
- I can see there's a path at (0,0) to my left

I'll move left to continue exploring for a way down.

Next move: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position (0,0):
- Below me at (1,0) is a dark grey path cell
- I need to find a way to reach the goal at (2,3)

I'll move down to explore this path.

Next move: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good! I'm at (1,0) and I can see the goal at (2,3).
- Below me at (2,0) is a dark grey path
- I need to continue moving through the maze to reach the goal

I'll move down.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (2,0) and the goal is at (2,3) - we're on the same row!
- To my right at (2,1) is a wall
- Below me at (3,0) is a dark grey path

I need to find a way around the wall. I'll go down first.

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,0) and need to reach the goal at (2,3).
- To my right at (3,1) is a wall
- Below me at (4,0) is a dark grey path

I'll continue down to explore more options.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,0) on the bottom row. I need to find a path to reach the goal at (2,3).
- To my right at (4,1) is a dark grey path

I'll move right to explore this route.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,1) and need to continue finding a path to the goal at (2,3).
- To my right at (4,2) is a dark grey path
- Above me at (3,1) is a wall

I'll continue moving right along the bottom row.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,2) and the goal is at (2,3).
- Above me at (3,2) is a dark grey path
- To my right at (4,3) is a dark grey path

I'll move up to get closer to the goal row.

Next move: (3,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an "L" shape. This is evident from the continuous path of non-wall cells that runs down the leftmost column from (0,0) to (4,0), then turns right along the bottom row from (4,0) to (4,4), forming a clear "L" pattern. The goal cell at (2,3) and the path to it branches off from this main L-shaped corridor.

Part 2: Here is my new L-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
S 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 1 G 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0
```

This maze maintains the L-shaped corridor pattern but with:
- Different start position (top left)
- Different goal position (middle right)
- Same basic L-shape formed by the corridors
- Valid path from start to goal
- Different internal layout while keeping the same overall shape
- Same 5x5 dimensions as the original

The path from start to goal requires navigating through the L-shaped corridor and then up to reach the goal, similar to but distinct from the original maze's solution pattern.
