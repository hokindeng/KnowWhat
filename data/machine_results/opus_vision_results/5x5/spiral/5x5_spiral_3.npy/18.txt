# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- I'm currently at position (0,3) - the BLUE cell
- The goal is at position (2,3) - the RED cell
- There's a wall directly below me at (1,3) blocking the direct path

From my current position (0,3), I can move:
- LEFT to (0,2) - which is a dark grey path cell
- RIGHT to (0,4) - which is also a dark grey path cell
- I cannot move DOWN to (1,3) because it's a white wall
- I cannot move UP as I'm already at the top edge

I'll need to find an alternate route around the walls. Let me start by moving left.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm now at (0,2). Looking at my surroundings:
- I cannot move DOWN to (1,2) because it's a white wall
- I can move LEFT to (0,1) which is a dark grey path
- I can move RIGHT back to (0,3) but that's where I came from
- I cannot move UP as I'm at the top edge

I'll continue moving left to explore alternative routes to the goal.

Next move: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (0,1). From here I can see:
- I can move LEFT to (0,0) which is a dark grey path
- I cannot move DOWN to (1,1) because it's a white wall
- I can move RIGHT back to (0,2) but that won't help progress
- I cannot move UP as I'm at the top edge

I'll continue exploring by moving left.

Next move: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (0,0) - the top-left corner. From here:
- I cannot move LEFT or UP as I'm at the edge
- I can move DOWN to (1,0) which is a dark grey path
- I can move RIGHT back to (0,1) but that would be backtracking

I need to explore downward to find a path around the walls to reach the goal.

Next move: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (1,0). From here:
- I can move DOWN to (2,0) which is a dark grey path
- I cannot move RIGHT to (1,1) because it's a white wall
- I can move UP back to (0,0) but that would be backtracking
- I cannot move LEFT as I'm at the left edge

I'll continue moving down to explore this path.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at (2,0). From here:
- I can move DOWN to (3,0) which is a dark grey path
- I cannot move RIGHT to (2,1) because it's a white wall
- I can move UP back to (1,0) but that would be backtracking
- I cannot move LEFT as I'm at the left edge

I'll continue exploring this path by moving down.

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (3,0). From here:
- I can move DOWN to (4,0) which is a dark grey path
- I cannot move RIGHT to (3,1) because it's a white wall
- I can move UP back to (2,0) but that would be backtracking
- I cannot move LEFT as I'm at the left edge

I'll continue exploring downward.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (4,0) - the bottom-left corner. From here:
- I can move RIGHT to (4,1) which is a dark grey path
- I can move UP back to (3,0) but that would be backtracking
- I cannot move DOWN as I'm at the bottom edge
- I cannot move LEFT as I'm at the left edge

I'll move right to continue exploring the path.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (4,1). From here:
- I can move RIGHT to (4,2) which is a dark grey path
- I cannot move UP to (3,1) because it's a white wall
- I cannot move DOWN as I'm at the bottom edge
- I can move LEFT back to (4,0) but that would be backtracking

I'll continue moving right along this path.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (4,2). From here:
- I can move RIGHT to (4,3) which is a dark grey path
- I cannot move UP to (3,2) because it's a white wall
- I cannot move DOWN as I'm at the bottom edge
- I can move LEFT back to (4,1) but that would be backtracking

I'll continue moving right.

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (4,3). Looking at the goal at (2,3), it's directly above me, but I can see that (3,3) is a white wall blocking the direct path. From my current position:
- I can move RIGHT to (4,4) which is a dark grey path
- I cannot move UP to (3,3) because it's a white wall
- I cannot move DOWN as I'm at the bottom edge
- I can move LEFT back to (4,2) but that would be backtracking

I'll continue exploring by moving right.

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (4,4) - the bottom-right corner. From here:
- I can move UP to (3,4) which is a dark grey path
- I can move LEFT back to (4,3) but that would be backtracking
- I cannot move RIGHT as I'm at the right edge
- I cannot move DOWN as I'm at the bottom edge

I'll move up to continue exploring a path toward the goal.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (3,4). The goal is at (2,3), which is one row up and one column to the left. From here:
- I can move UP to (2,4) which is a dark grey path
- I cannot move LEFT to (3,3) because it's a white wall
- I cannot move RIGHT as I'm at the right edge
- I can move DOWN back to (4,4) but that would be backtracking

I'll move up to get to the same row as the goal.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at (2,4) and I can see the goal at (2,3) is directly to my left. I'm on the same row as the goal now. From here:
- I can move LEFT to (2,3) which is the RED goal cell!
- I cannot move UP to (1,4) because it's a white wall
- I cannot move RIGHT as I'm at the right edge
- I can move DOWN back to (3,4) but that would be backtracking

I can reach the goal with my next move!

Next move: (2,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an "L" shape. This is evident from how the non-wall cells create a path that starts at the top, goes down the left side, and then extends across the bottom, forming a clear "L" pattern. The corridors occupy the top row, the leftmost column, and the bottom row of the maze.

Part 2: Here is my new L-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
0 0 0 S 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 G 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

This maze:
- Maintains the L-shape pattern of corridors
- Has different start and goal positions than the original
- Provides a valid path from S to G
- Uses walls (1) to block off areas that shouldn't be accessible
- Keeps the same 5x5 dimensions
- Creates a different layout while maintaining the same basic shape
- The L-shape is inverted compared to the original, demonstrating that the same shape can be oriented differently

The path from S to G is possible by following the corridors (0s) around the L-shape, and there are multiple valid routes to reach the goal, making it an interesting but solvable maze.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
