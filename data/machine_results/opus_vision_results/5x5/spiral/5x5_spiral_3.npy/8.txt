# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (0,3)
- The goal (RED): (2,3)
- There's a wall blocking the direct path down at (1,3)

I need to navigate around the wall. I'll start by moving left to find a path around the obstacle.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm now at (0,2). I can see that there's a wall directly below me at (1,2). I need to find a path around the walls to reach the goal at (2,3).

Looking at the available paths, I'll continue moving left to find a way down.

Next move: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,1) now. I see there's a wall below me at (1,1). I need to continue finding a path around the walls. Let me move left to explore that direction.

Next move: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (0,0). I can see a dark grey path below me. Let me move down to continue exploring the maze.

Next move: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm at (1,0). I can see there's a dark grey path below me. I'll move down to continue navigating toward the goal.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (2,0) and I can see I'm on the same row as the goal at (2,3). However, there's a wall at (2,1) blocking the direct path. I need to find another route. Let me move down to continue exploring.

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,0). I see there's a wall to my right at (3,1), so I can't go directly toward the goal. Let me continue down to explore alternative paths.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,0) now. I can see there's a dark grey path to my right. Let me move right to continue exploring paths that might lead to the goal.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,1). I can see more dark grey paths to my right. Let me continue moving right to explore the bottom row and find a path that leads up to the goal.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,2). I can continue moving right along the bottom row to explore more paths. The goal is at (2,3) above me.

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (4,3) which is directly below the goal at (2,3). However, I see there's a wall at (3,3) blocking the direct path up. Let me continue exploring by moving right.

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,4) in the bottom right corner. I can see there's a dark grey path above me. Let me move up to continue finding a route to the goal.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Great! I'm at (3,4) and I can see a dark grey path above me at (2,4). The goal is at (2,3), just to the left of that position. Let me move up.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm at (2,4) and the goal is right next to me at (2,3). I can move left to reach the goal!

Next move: (2,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an "L" shape. This is evident from the continuous path of non-wall cells that starts at the top, goes down the left side, and then extends across the bottom, forming a clear "L" pattern. The non-wall cells include (0,0) through (0,4) across the top row, (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0) down the left side, and (4,1) through (4,4) across the bottom.

Part 2: Here is my new L-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
S 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

This maze:
- Maintains the L-shape pattern of corridors
- Has different start and goal positions than the original
- Provides a valid path from S to G
- Uses the same 5x5 dimensions
- Creates a different layout while keeping the same basic shape
- The path follows the top of the L and then down the right side, rather than down the left side and across as in the original

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
