# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (0,3)
- The goal (RED): (2,3)
- There's a wall at (1,3) blocking the direct path down

I need to find an alternate route. From my current position, I can move left to (0,2) or right to (0,4). Since I need to navigate around the walls, I'll start by moving left.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm currently at (0,2). I can see that (1,2) below me is a wall, so I need to find an alternate path to reach the goal at (2,3).

Looking at the available paths, I'll move left to continue exploring.

Next move: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm currently at (0,1). I can see that (1,1) below me is a wall. I'll continue exploring by moving left to find a path around the walls.

Next move: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,0). I can see that (1,0) below me is a dark grey cell (path), so I can move there. This will help me explore downward to find a path to the goal.

Next move: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (1,0). I can see that (2,0) below me is a dark grey cell (path), so I can move there. This will bring me to the same row as the goal.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (2,0) and need to reach the goal at (2,3). I can see that (2,1) to my right is a wall, so I cannot move directly toward the goal. I'll move down to explore another path.

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,0). I can see that (3,1) to my right is a wall, so I'll continue down to explore the bottom path.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,0). I can see that (4,1) to my right is a dark grey cell (path), so I can move there to continue exploring the bottom row.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,1). I can see that (4,2) to my right is a dark grey cell (path), so I can continue moving right along the bottom row.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,2). I can see that (4,3) to my right is a dark grey cell (path), so I can continue moving right.

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,3). I can see that (3,3) above me is a wall, so I cannot move directly up toward the goal. I'll move right to continue exploring.

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,4). I can see that (3,4) above me is a dark grey cell (path), so I can move up.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,4). I can see that (2,4) above me is a dark grey cell (path), so I can move up to get to the same row as the goal.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (2,4) and I can see the goal (RED cell) is right next to me at (2,3). I'll move left to reach it.

Next move: (2,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an "L" shape. This is evident from how the non-wall cells create a path that starts at the top, goes down the left side, and then extends to the right along the bottom, forming a clear "L" pattern. The corridors include cells at the top row, down the leftmost column, and across the bottom row.

Part 2: Here is my new L-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
0 0 0 S 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 G 0
```

This maze:
- Maintains the L-shape pattern of corridors
- Has different start/goal positions than the original
- Provides a valid path from S to G
- Uses the same 5x5 dimensions
- Creates the L-shape using different specific cell arrangements while keeping the general pattern
- Has at least one valid solution
- Uses the specified encoding format (0,1,S,G)

The L-shape is formed by the corridor running along the top and down the right side, which is a rotated version of the original maze's L-shape but maintains the same basic pattern.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
