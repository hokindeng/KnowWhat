# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (0,3)
- Goal position (RED): (2,3)
- There's a wall directly below me at (1,3)

From my current position at (0,3), I can move:
- LEFT to (0,2) - this is a dark grey path cell
- RIGHT to (0,4) - this is a dark grey path cell
- I cannot move UP (out of bounds) or DOWN (wall at (1,3))

Since there's a wall blocking the direct path down, I'll need to navigate around it. I'll start by moving left to find an alternate route.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I've moved to (0,2). Now I need to find a path to reach the goal at (2,3).

From my current position at (0,2), I can see:
- DOWN at (1,2) is a WHITE wall - cannot move there
- LEFT at (0,1) is a dark grey path - can move there
- RIGHT at (0,3) is a dark grey path - can move there

Since I can't go down directly, I'll continue exploring to the left to find an alternate route.

Next move: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (0,1). Looking at my options:
- DOWN at (1,1) is a WHITE wall - cannot move there
- LEFT at (0,0) is a dark grey path - can move there
- RIGHT at (0,2) is where I came from

Let me continue left to explore if there's a path down from there.

Next move: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,0) now. Looking at my options:
- DOWN at (1,0) is a dark grey path - I can move there!
- RIGHT at (0,1) is where I came from
- I cannot go UP or LEFT (out of bounds)

Great! I found a path down. Let me move down to explore further.

Next move: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good! I'm at (1,0) now. Let me check my options:
- DOWN at (2,0) is a dark grey path - I can move there
- RIGHT at (1,1) is a WHITE wall - cannot move there
- UP at (0,0) is where I came from
- LEFT is out of bounds

I'll continue moving down to explore this path.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (2,0) and the goal is at (2,3) - we're on the same row! Let me check if I can move right toward the goal:
- RIGHT at (2,1) is a WHITE wall - cannot move there
- DOWN at (3,0) is a dark grey path - can move there
- UP at (1,0) is where I came from

I can't move directly right due to the wall. I'll need to go down and find another route.

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,0). Looking at my options:
- RIGHT at (3,1) is a WHITE wall - cannot move there  
- DOWN at (4,0) is a dark grey path - can move there
- UP at (2,0) is where I came from
- LEFT is out of bounds

I'll continue down to explore further paths.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,0) at the bottom of the maze. Let me check my options:
- RIGHT at (4,1) is a dark grey path - can move there
- UP at (3,0) is where I came from
- DOWN is out of bounds
- LEFT is out of bounds

I'll move right along the bottom row to find a path upward.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,1). Let me check my options:
- UP at (3,1) is a WHITE wall - cannot move there
- RIGHT at (4,2) is a dark grey path - can move there
- LEFT at (4,0) is where I came from
- DOWN is out of bounds

I'll continue moving right along the bottom row.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,2). Let me check my options:
- UP at (3,2) is a dark grey path - I can move there!
- RIGHT at (4,3) is a dark grey path - can move there
- LEFT at (4,1) is where I came from
- DOWN is out of bounds

Since the goal is at (2,3), I should move up to get closer to row 2.

Next move: (3,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an "L" shape. This is evident from the way the non-wall cells create a path that starts at the top row, goes down the leftmost column, and then extends right along the bottom row, forming a clear "L" pattern when viewing all accessible cells together.

Part 2: Here is my new L-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
S 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1
```

This maze:
- Maintains the L-shape pattern of accessible corridors
- Has different start/goal positions than the original
- Provides a valid path from S to G
- Uses the same 5x5 dimensions
- Creates the L-shape using a different corridor arrangement while maintaining the basic L pattern
- Includes walls (1), corridors (0), start position (S), and goal position (G)

The path from start to goal is possible by moving down the vertical part of the L and then right along the horizontal part to reach the goal.
