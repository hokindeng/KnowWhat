# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (blue cell): (0,3)
- The goal (red cell): (2,3)
- There's a wall blocking the direct path down at (1,3)

I need to find an alternate route. From my current position, I can move:
- LEFT to (0,2) - This is a dark grey path cell
- RIGHT to (0,4) - This is a dark grey path cell
- I cannot move DOWN to (1,3) as it's a white wall
- I cannot move UP as I'm at the top edge

I'll start by moving left to begin navigating around the wall.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I've moved to (0,2). Now I need to find a way down to reach the goal at (2,3).

From my current position at (0,2), I can see:
- I cannot move DOWN to (1,2) as it's a white wall
- I can move LEFT to (0,1) which is a dark grey path
- I can move RIGHT back to (0,3) but that's where I came from

I'll continue moving left to explore that path.

Next move: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (0,1). Looking at my options:
- I cannot move DOWN to (1,1) as it's a white wall
- I can move LEFT to (0,0) which is a dark grey path
- I can move RIGHT back to (0,2) but that would be backtracking

I'll continue exploring by moving left.

Next move: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (0,0), which is a corner. From here:
- I cannot move DOWN to (1,0) as it's a white wall
- I cannot move UP or LEFT as I'm at the edge of the maze
- I can only move RIGHT back to (0,1)

I need to backtrack to find another path.

Next move: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (0,1). Since going left led to a dead end, I'll now go right to continue exploring.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (0,2). Since I've already explored the left path, I'll now continue to the right.

Next move: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at my starting position (0,3). Since I can't go down directly due to the wall at (1,3), I need to explore the right path. I can see (0,4) is a dark grey path cell.

Next move: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,4) now, which is another corner. From here:
- I cannot move DOWN to (1,4) as it's a white wall
- I cannot move UP or RIGHT as I'm at the edge of the maze
- I can only move LEFT back to (0,3)

Looking at the maze pattern, I notice that the entire row 1 is walls. I need to find another way to get to row 2 where the goal is. Let me backtrack.

Next move: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (0,3). Looking at the maze, I notice that the entire row 1 consists of white walls, which means there's no direct path from row 0 to row 2 where the goal is located. This appears to be an impossible maze since I cannot cross the wall barrier in row 1.

However, let me continue exploring to make sure I haven't missed anything. I'll go back to explore more of row 0.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,2). I've now explored the entire accessible area of row 0, and I've confirmed that all cells in row 1 are white walls (obstacles). This creates an impassable barrier between my starting area (row 0) and the goal location at (2,3).

This maze appears to be impossible to solve as there is no valid path from the starting position to the goal. The wall in row 1 completely blocks any movement from row 0 to row 2.

However, to be thorough, let me continue exploring. I'll move back to check all positions.

Next move: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,1). I've now confirmed that every cell in row 1 is a white wall, making it impossible to reach the goal at (2,3) from my starting position in row 0. This maze has no solution because there's no path through the wall barrier.

However, I'll continue to demonstrate that I've exhaustively explored all available paths. Let me go back to (0,0).

Next move: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I've now explored all accessible cells in row 0. The maze appears to be impossible to solve because:
- All cells in row 1 are white walls (obstacles)
- This creates an impassable barrier between row 0 (where I can move) and row 2 (where the goal is)
- There is no valid path from my starting area to the goal at (2,3)

However, I'll continue moving to demonstrate the complete exploration. Let me return to the other side.

Next move: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,1). I have now thoroughly explored all accessible areas in row 0, and confirmed that the entire row 1 is a wall barrier. This maze is impossible to solve as there is no path from the starting area to the goal at (2,3).

The wall in row 1 completely separates the accessible area (row 0) from the goal area (row 2). Despite this, I'll continue moving to complete the exploration.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,2). I've confirmed that this maze cannot be solved. The entire row 1 forms a wall barrier that prevents any path from row 0 to the goal at (2,3). 

However, I'll continue to demonstrate that I've explored all available cells. Let me move to the right.

Next move: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at my starting position (0,3). I have now visited every accessible cell in row 0, and confirmed that all of row 1 is a wall barrier. This maze is impossible to solve as there is no path to the goal at (2,3).

Let me complete one more move to the right to show I've explored all options.

Next move: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,4), the rightmost position in row 0. I have now visited all accessible cells in row 0:
- (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), and (0,4)

All cells in row 1 are white walls, creating an impassable barrier that prevents reaching the goal at (2,3). This maze is impossible to solve.

I can only move back left from here.

Next move: (0,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a horizontal line shape. This is evident from the fact that all accessible non-wall cells are confined to row 0, forming a single straight line across the top of the maze. The rest of the maze below this line is either walls or inaccessible areas.

Part 2: Here is my new horizontal-line-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5), but with a solvable path:

```
S 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- I maintained the horizontal line shape in row 0
- I placed the start 'S' and goal 'G' at opposite ends of the line
- All cells below row 0 are walls (1's)
- There is a clear path from start to goal along the top row
- The maze has the same 5x5 dimensions as the original
- The shape pattern (horizontal line) is preserved
- Unlike the original unsolvable maze, this one can be completed

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
