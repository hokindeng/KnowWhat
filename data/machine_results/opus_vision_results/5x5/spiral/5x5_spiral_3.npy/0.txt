# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- I'm currently at position (0,3) - the BLUE cell
- The goal is at position (2,3) - the RED cell
- There's a wall blocking the direct path downward at (1,3)

From my current position (0,3), I can move:
- LEFT to (0,2) - which is a dark grey path
- RIGHT to (0,4) - which is a dark grey path
- I cannot move DOWN to (1,3) because it's a white wall
- I cannot move UP as it would be out of bounds

Since there's a wall directly below me, I'll need to find an alternate route. I'll start by moving left.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I've moved to (0,2). Now I need to find a way around the walls to reach the goal at (2,3).

From my current position (0,2), I can see:
- I cannot move DOWN to (1,2) because it's a white wall
- I can move LEFT to (0,1) - dark grey path
- I can move RIGHT to (0,3) - dark grey path

I'll continue moving left to explore that direction.

Next move: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (0,1). Looking at my options:
- I cannot move DOWN to (1,1) because it's a white wall
- I can move LEFT to (0,0) - dark grey path
- I can move RIGHT to (0,2) - dark grey path (where I came from)

I'll continue exploring by moving left.

Next move: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (0,0). From here, I can see:
- I cannot move UP or LEFT (out of bounds)
- I can move DOWN to (1,0) - dark grey path
- I can move RIGHT to (0,1) - where I came from

I need to find a way down to reach the goal, so I'll move down.

Next move: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm at (1,0). From here:
- I can move DOWN to (2,0) - dark grey path
- I cannot move RIGHT to (1,1) because it's a white wall
- I can move UP to (0,0) - where I came from
- I cannot move LEFT (out of bounds)

I'll continue moving down towards the goal level.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm now at (2,0), on the same row as the goal at (2,3). However, I can see there's a wall at (2,1) blocking the direct path. From my current position:
- I can move DOWN to (3,0) - dark grey path
- I cannot move RIGHT to (2,1) because it's a white wall
- I can move UP to (1,0) - where I came from
- I cannot move LEFT (out of bounds)

Since I can't go directly right, I'll continue exploring by going down.

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,0). Looking at my options:
- I cannot move RIGHT to (3,1) because it's a white wall
- I can move DOWN to (4,0) - dark grey path
- I can move UP to (2,0) - where I came from
- I cannot move LEFT (out of bounds)

I'll continue exploring downward.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,0), the bottom-left corner. From here:
- I can move RIGHT to (4,1) - dark grey path
- I can move UP to (3,0) - where I came from
- I cannot move DOWN or LEFT (out of bounds)

I'll move right to explore this bottom row.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,1). From here:
- I can move RIGHT to (4,2) - dark grey path
- I cannot move UP to (3,1) because it's a white wall
- I can move LEFT to (4,0) - where I came from
- I cannot move DOWN (out of bounds)

I'll continue moving right along the bottom row.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,2). From here:
- I can move RIGHT to (4,3) - dark grey path
- I cannot move UP to (3,2) because it's a white wall
- I can move LEFT to (4,1) - where I came from
- I cannot move DOWN (out of bounds)

I'll continue moving right.

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,3), directly below the goal at (2,3). From here:
- I cannot move UP to (3,3) because it's a white wall
- I can move RIGHT to (4,4) - dark grey path
- I can move LEFT to (4,2) - where I came from
- I cannot move DOWN (out of bounds)

I'll continue exploring by moving right.

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,4), the bottom-right corner. From here:
- I can move UP to (3,4) - dark grey path
- I can move LEFT to (4,3) - where I came from
- I cannot move RIGHT or DOWN (out of bounds)

I'll move up to explore the right side of the maze.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,4). From here:
- I can move UP to (2,4) - dark grey path
- I cannot move LEFT to (3,3) because it's a white wall
- I can move DOWN to (4,4) - where I came from
- I cannot move RIGHT (out of bounds)

I'll move up to get to the same row as the goal.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm at (2,4), on the same row as the goal at (2,3). From here:
- I can move LEFT to (2,3) - the RED goal cell!
- I cannot move UP to (1,4) because it's a white wall
- I can move DOWN to (3,4) - where I came from
- I cannot move RIGHT (out of bounds)

I can reach the goal by moving left!

Next move: (2,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an inverted "L" shape (or backwards "Î“" shape). This is evident from how the non-wall cells create a path that runs along the top row, then down the left column, and finally across the bottom row, forming an inverted "L" pattern.

Part 2: Here is my new inverted L-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
0 0 0 S 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 G 0
```

This maze:
- Maintains the inverted L shape with corridors along the top, left side, and bottom
- Has different start (S) and goal (G) positions than the original
- Provides a valid path from S to G
- Uses walls (1) to block off the center area, maintaining the L shape
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions as the original
- Creates a different layout while keeping the same basic shape pattern

The path from S to G requires traveling along the inverted L shape, similar to the original maze but with different start and end points.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
