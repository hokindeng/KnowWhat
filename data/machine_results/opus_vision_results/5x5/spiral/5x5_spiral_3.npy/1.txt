# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (0,3)
- The goal (RED): (2,3)
- There's a wall directly below me at (1,3)

I need to find a path around the walls. From my current position, I can move:
- LEFT to (0,2) - which is a dark grey path cell
- RIGHT to (0,4) - which is also a dark grey path cell

I cannot move DOWN to (1,3) because it's a white wall cell.

I'll start by moving left to begin navigating around the wall.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm now at (0,2). Looking at the maze:
- My current position (BLUE): (0,2)
- The goal (RED): (2,3)
- There's a wall directly below me at (1,2)

I need to continue navigating around the walls. From my current position, I can:
- Move LEFT to (0,1) - dark grey path
- Move RIGHT to (0,3) - dark grey path
- Cannot move DOWN to (1,2) - white wall

I'll move right to get closer to the goal column.

Next move: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (0,3). Looking at the maze:
- My current position (BLUE): (0,3)
- The goal (RED): (2,3) - directly below me but blocked by a wall at (1,3)
- There's a wall directly below me at (1,3)

From my current position, I can:
- Move LEFT to (0,2) - dark grey path (where I just came from)
- Move RIGHT to (0,4) - dark grey path
- Cannot move DOWN to (1,3) - white wall

I'll move right to explore that path and find a way around the wall.

Next move: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm at (0,4). Looking at the maze:
- My current position (BLUE): (0,4)
- The goal (RED): (2,3)
- There's a wall directly below me at (1,4)

From my current position, I can:
- Move LEFT to (0,3) - dark grey path
- Cannot move RIGHT - I'm at the edge of the maze
- Cannot move DOWN to (1,4) - white wall

This path is blocked too. I need to go back and explore the left side of the maze to find a way around the walls.

Next move: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (0,3). Looking at the maze more carefully, I can see that the entire row 1 is blocked by walls except for (1,0) on the far left. I need to go left to reach that opening.

From my current position, I'll move left to continue exploring.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,2). Looking at the maze, I can see that (1,0) is the only dark grey path cell in row 1. I need to go further left to reach it.

Next move: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,1). I need to continue left to reach (0,0) and then go down to (1,0), which is the only open path in row 1.

Next move: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (0,0). Now I can see that (1,0) is a dark grey path cell. I'll move down to it.

Next move: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Excellent! I'm at (1,0). Now I can see that (2,0) is a dark grey path cell. I'll move down to continue toward row 2 where the goal is located.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Great! I'm at (2,0), which is on the same row as the goal at (2,3). However, I can see that (2,1) is a white wall, so I can't move directly right. I need to find another path. I'll move down to (3,0) which is a dark grey path cell.

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,0). Looking at the maze, I can see that (3,1) is a white wall to my right. I need to continue down to (4,0) which is a dark grey path cell, then find a way to navigate to the goal.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,0). I can see the entire bottom row is dark grey path cells. I'll start moving right along this row to get closer to column 3 where the goal is.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,1). I'll continue moving right along the bottom row to get closer to column 3 where the goal is.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,2). I need to continue right to get to column 3, where the goal is located.

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (4,3), in the same column as the goal at (2,3). However, I can see that (3,3) is a white wall cell, so I can't go directly up. I need to find another path. Let me move right to (4,4) to explore that route.

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,4). I can see that (3,4) above me is a dark grey path cell. I'll move up to continue finding a path to the goal.

Next move: (3,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an "L" shape. This is evident from the continuous path of non-wall cells that starts at the top row, goes down the leftmost column, and then extends right along the bottom row, creating a clear "L" pattern. The dark grey and colored cells together form this distinctive "L" shape when viewed as a whole.

Part 2: Here is my new L-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
S 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0
```

This maze:
- Maintains the L-shape pattern of corridors
- Has different start/goal positions than the original
- Provides a valid path from S to G
- Uses the same 5x5 dimensions
- Creates the L-shape using a top horizontal corridor and right vertical corridor
- Is distinct from the original maze while keeping the same basic shape pattern

The path from S to G is possible by moving right along the top corridor and then down the rightmost corridor to reach the goal.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
