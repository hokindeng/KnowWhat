# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- I'm currently at position (0,3) - the BLUE cell
- The goal is at position (2,3) - the RED cell
- There's a wall directly below me at (1,3)

Since I cannot move directly down due to the wall, I need to find an alternate path. I can see that I can move left to (0,2) which is a dark grey path cell.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Good, I'm now at position (0,2). I can see the goal is still at (2,3). 

Looking at the available paths:
- There's a wall directly below me at (1,2)
- I can move left to (0,1) which is a dark grey path
- I can move right to (0,3) which is also a dark grey path

Since I need to find a way around the walls to reach the goal, I'll move left to explore that direction.

Next move: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (0,1). Looking at my options:
- There's a wall below me at (1,1)
- I can move left to (0,0) which is a dark grey path
- I can move right back to (0,2) where I came from

Since I need to find a way around the walls, I'll continue exploring by moving left.

Next move: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at position (0,0). Looking at my options:
- I can move down to (1,0) which is a dark grey path
- I can move right back to (0,1) where I came from
- I'm at the edge of the maze, so I can't go up or left

I'll move down to continue exploring for a path to the goal.

Next move: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at position (1,0). Looking at my options:
- There's a wall to my right at (1,1)
- I can move down to (2,0) which is a dark grey path
- I can move up back to (0,0) where I came from

I'll continue moving down to explore further.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Great! I'm at position (2,0) and I can see the goal is at (2,3) - we're on the same row! However, there's a wall at (2,1) blocking the direct path.

Looking at my options:
- There's a wall to my right at (2,1)
- I can move down to (3,0) which is a dark grey path
- I can move up back to (1,0) where I came from

I'll move down to explore if there's a path around the wall.

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at position (3,0). Looking at my options:
- There's a wall to my right at (3,1)
- I can move down to (4,0) which is a dark grey path
- I can move up back to (2,0) where I came from

Since there's no path to the right on this row, I'll continue down to see if there's a path on the bottom row.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at position (4,0), the bottom-left corner. Looking at my options:
- I can move right to (4,1) which is a dark grey path
- I can move up back to (3,0) where I came from
- I'm at the edge of the maze, so I can't go down or left

I'll move right to explore the bottom row for a path.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at position (4,1). Looking at my options:
- There's a wall above me at (3,1)
- I can move right to (4,2) which is a dark grey path
- I can move left back to (4,0) where I came from

I'll continue moving right along the bottom row.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at position (4,2). Looking at my options:
- There's a wall above me at (3,2)
- I can move right to (4,3) which is a dark grey path
- I can move left back to (4,1) where I came from

I'll continue moving right along the bottom row.

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at position (4,3). The goal is at (2,3) directly above me, but there's a wall at (3,3) blocking the direct path. Looking at my options:
- There's a wall above me at (3,3)
- I can move right to (4,4) which is a dark grey path
- I can move left back to (4,2) where I came from

I'll move right to continue exploring for a path upward.

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at position (4,4), the bottom-right corner. Looking at my options:
- I can move up to (3,4) which is a dark grey path
- I can move left back to (4,3) where I came from
- I'm at the edge of the maze, so I can't go right or down

I'll move up to explore for a path toward the goal.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at position (3,4). The goal is at (2,3), which is one row up and one column to the left. Looking at my options:
- There's a wall to my left at (3,3)
- I can move up to (2,4) which is a dark grey path
- I can move down back to (4,4) where I came from

I'll move up to get closer to the goal row.

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at position (2,4) and the goal is at (2,3) - just one cell to my left on the same row. I can now move directly to the goal!

Next move: (2,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an inverted "T" shape. This is evident from the way the non-wall cells create a vertical line down the left side from top to bottom, and a horizontal line across the bottom row from left to right, forming an upside-down T pattern.

Part 2: Here is my new inverted T-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 G 1
0 1 1 0 1
S 0 0 0 1
```

This maze:
- Maintains the inverted T shape of corridors
- Has different start/goal positions than the original
- Provides a valid path from S to G
- Uses the same 5x5 dimensions
- Creates the T shape with a vertical corridor on the left and horizontal corridor at the bottom
- Is not identical to the original maze while maintaining the same general shape pattern
- Has a valid solution path: start → right → up → to goal

The inverted T shape is preserved but rotated slightly compared to the original, demonstrating that the same shape pattern can be implemented in different ways while maintaining a valid maze structure.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
