# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (0,3)
- The goal (RED): (2,3)
- Walls (WHITE) blocking row 1 at columns 1-3, and row 3 at columns 1-3

I need to find a path around these walls. From my current position, I can't move directly down due to the wall at (1,3). I can either go left or right.

The most efficient path appears to be going right and then down through column 4, which is clear of walls.

Next move: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm now at (0,4). I need to reach the goal at (2,3). 

Looking at the maze, I can see that (1,4) below me is a wall (WHITE), so I cannot move down. I need to go back left to find another path.

Next move: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm back at (0,3). Since I can't go directly down due to the wall at (1,3), and going right led to a dead end, I need to go left to find another path.

Next move: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,2). Looking at the maze, I can see that (1,2) below me is a wall (WHITE), so I cannot go down. I need to continue moving left to find a path around the walls.

Next move: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,1). I can see that (1,1) below me is a wall (WHITE), so I cannot go down. I'll continue moving left to find a path around the walls.

Next move: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (0,0). Now I can see that (1,0) below me is a dark grey cell (passable). This looks like a viable path since I need to go around the wall that blocks row 1.

Next move: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (1,0). I can see that (2,0) below me is a dark grey cell (passable). I'll continue moving down to work my way around the walls.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (2,0). I can see (2,1) to my right is a wall (WHITE), so I cannot go directly toward the goal. I need to continue finding a path around. I'll move down to (3,0) which is a dark grey cell.

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,0). I can see that (3,1) to my right is a wall (WHITE), so I cannot go directly right. I'll continue moving down to (4,0) which is a dark grey cell.

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,0). Now I'm at the bottom row and can see that the entire row 4 is passable (dark grey cells). I need to move right along this row to eventually reach a position where I can move up toward the goal at (2,3).

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,1). I need to continue moving right along row 4 to position myself under the goal. I can see (4,2) is a dark grey cell.

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,2). I need to continue moving right to position myself directly below the goal. I can see (4,3) is a dark grey cell.

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,3), directly below the goal at (2,3). However, I can see that (3,3) above me is a wall (WHITE), so I cannot go directly up. I'll move right to continue finding a path.

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (4,4). I can see that (3,4) above me is a dark grey cell. I'll move up to start making my way toward the goal.

Next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm at (3,4). I can see that (2,4) above me is a dark grey cell. I'll move up to get closer to the goal which is at (2,3).

Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! I'm at (2,4) and the goal is at (2,3), which is directly to my left. I can move there to complete the maze!

Next move: (2,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an "L" shape. This is evident from the way the passable cells create a path that starts at the top, goes down the left side, and then extends to the right along the bottom, forming a clear "L" pattern. The non-wall cells (dark grey, blue, and red) collectively create this L-shaped corridor.

Part 2: Here is my new L-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
0 0 S 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 0
1 G 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
```

This maze:
- Maintains the L-shape pattern of corridors
- Has different start (S) and goal (G) positions than the original
- Provides a valid path from S to G
- Uses the same 5x5 dimensions
- Creates the L-shape using a different specific arrangement of cells
- Follows the encoding format with 1 (walls), 0 (corridors), S (start), and G (goal)

The L-shape is maintained by having corridors along the top row and down the left side, but with a different internal structure than the original maze while still ensuring a valid solution exists.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
