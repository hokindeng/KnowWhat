# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in five directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or DIAGONAL
2. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
3. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
4. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (4,4)
- The goal (RED): (2,3)
- Dark grey paths I can move through: cells in row 1, cell (3,2), and cells in row 4

From my current position at (4,4), I can only move to adjacent cells that are dark grey. Looking at the cells around me:
- (3,4) above me is white (wall) - cannot move there
- (4,3) to my left is dark grey (path) - I can move there

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position at (4,3), I need to find a path to reach the goal at (2,3).

From (4,3), I can see the adjacent cells:
- (3,2) - dark grey (path) - I can move there
- (3,3) - white (wall) - cannot move there
- (4,2) - dark grey (path) - I can move there
- (4,4) - dark grey (path) - but that's where I came from

The best move is to go to (3,2) because from there I can move diagonally to reach the goal at (2,3).

Next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Great! I'm now at (3,2) and I can see the goal at (2,3) is diagonally adjacent to my current position. Since diagonal movement is allowed, I can move directly to the goal.

Next move: (2,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "7" shape. This is evident from the horizontal line of corridors at the top (row 1) connecting to a vertical line of corridors on the right side (going down through rows 3 and 4), creating a shape that resembles the number 7.

Part 2: Here is my new 7-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 0 S 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

This maze:
- Maintains the "7" shape with corridors along the top and right side
- Has different start and goal positions than the original
- Maintains the same 5x5 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from S to G
- Uses the specified encoding format
- Creates a different layout while keeping the same basic shape pattern

The path from S to G is possible by moving up and then right through the corridors, following the 7 shape pattern.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
