# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in five directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or DIAGONAL
2. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
3. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
4. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see:
- My current position (BLUE): (0,3)
- The goal (RED): (4,1)
- I need to navigate through the dark grey paths avoiding white walls

Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position (0,3):
- UP: Not possible (edge of maze)
- DOWN: (1,3) - This is a dark grey cell, so valid
- LEFT: (0,2) - This is a dark grey cell, so valid
- RIGHT: (0,4) - This is a dark grey cell, so valid
- DIAGONALS: (1,2) is white (wall), (1,4) is white (wall)

To reach the goal at (4,1), I need to move downward and leftward. The most direct path appears to go through (1,3).

Next move: (1,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my current position (1,3) in blue, I need to find a path to the goal at (4,1).

From (1,3), let me check my possible moves:
- UP: (0,3) - dark grey, valid but moves away from goal
- DOWN: (2,3) - white wall, blocked
- LEFT: (1,2) - white wall, blocked  
- RIGHT: (1,4) - white wall, blocked
- DIAGONAL DOWN-LEFT: (2,2) - dark grey, valid
- DIAGONAL DOWN-RIGHT: (2,4) - white wall, blocked
- DIAGONAL UP-LEFT: (0,2) - dark grey, valid
- DIAGONAL UP-RIGHT: (0,4) - dark grey, valid

Since I need to move downward and leftward to reach (4,1), the best move is diagonally down-left to (2,2).

Next move: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (2,2), I need to continue toward the goal at (4,1).

Let me check my possible moves from (2,2):
- UP: (1,2) - white wall, blocked
- DOWN: (3,2) - white wall, blocked
- LEFT: (2,1) - white wall, blocked
- RIGHT: (2,3) - white wall, blocked
- DIAGONAL UP-LEFT: (1,1) - white wall, blocked
- DIAGONAL UP-RIGHT: (1,3) - dark grey, valid
- DIAGONAL DOWN-LEFT: (3,1) - dark grey, valid
- DIAGONAL DOWN-RIGHT: (3,3) - white wall, blocked

Since I need to move downward and leftward to reach the goal, the best move is diagonally down-left to (3,1).

Next move: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Perfect! From my current position at (3,1), I can see the goal is directly below me at (4,1).

Let me check my possible moves from (3,1):
- DOWN: (4,1) - This is the RED goal cell!

I can move directly to the goal.

Next move: (4,1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "7" shape. This is evident from the continuous path of dark grey cells that starts at the top row spanning several cells, then makes a diagonal descent toward the bottom-left portion of the maze, creating a pattern that resembles the number 7.

Part 2: Here is my new 7-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
0 0 0 S 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
0 G 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
```

This maze:
- Maintains the "7" shape pattern of corridors
- Has different start/goal positions while keeping the same general shape
- Provides a valid path from S to G
- Uses the same 5x5 dimensions
- Creates a different layout while preserving the characteristic "7" shape of connected corridors
- The path follows the top horizontal segment and then descends diagonally toward the bottom left, just like in a "7"

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
