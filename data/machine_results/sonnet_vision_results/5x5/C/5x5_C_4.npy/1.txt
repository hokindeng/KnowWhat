# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
I can see the maze with my current position (blue cell) at (4,1) and the goal (red cell) at (0,1). Looking at the available paths (dark grey cells), I can move to adjacent grey cells while avoiding the white wall cells.

From my current position at (4,1), I can move to the grey cell at (4,0).

Next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (4,0), I can move upward to (3,0) since it's a grey cell.

Next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (3,0), I can move upward to (2,0) since it's a grey cell.

Next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (2,0), I can move upward to (1,0) since it's a grey cell.

Next move: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (1,0), I can move upward to (0,0) since it's a grey cell.

Next move: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (0,0), I can move right to (0,1) which is the red goal cell.

Next move: (0,1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an "L" shape. This is evident from the continuous path of non-wall cells that starts at the top, goes straight down along the leftmost column, and then extends right along the bottom row, creating a clear "L" pattern.

Part 2: Here is my new L-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
S 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1
```

This maze maintains the L-shape pattern of corridors but with:
- The start position moved to the top
- The goal position moved to the bottom right of the L
- A valid path exists from S to G following the L shape
- The same dimensions (5x5) as the original
- Different layout while maintaining the core L-shape pattern

The L-shape is preserved by having a vertical corridor down the left side and a horizontal corridor along the bottom, just like in the original maze, but with the start and goal positions rearranged to create a different solving experience.
