# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in five directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or DIAGONAL
2. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
3. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
4. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
I can see the maze layout where I'm currently positioned at the blue cell (2,6) and need to reach the red goal cell at (6,6). Looking at the available paths through the dark grey cells, I can see a valid route.

For my first move, I'll move down to the adjacent dark grey cell.

Next move: (3,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm currently at (3,6) and need to continue making my way down to the goal at (6,6). I can see there's a path of dark grey cells that will lead me there. I'll continue moving down to the next dark grey cell.

Next move: (4,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm currently at (4,6) and continuing my path down toward the goal at (6,6). I'll move down to the next dark grey cell.

Next move: (5,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I'm currently at (5,6) and I can now make the final move to reach the red goal cell at (6,6).

Next move: (6,6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form a "7" shape. This is evident from the horizontal line at the top (row 1) and the vertical line down the right side (column 6), with all non-wall cells forming this characteristic "7" pattern. The corridors start with a horizontal stretch across the top and then make a 90-degree turn downward along the rightmost column.

Part 2: Here is my new "7"-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 S 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
```

This maze maintains the "7" shape pattern with:
- A horizontal corridor across the top (row 1)
- A vertical corridor down the right side
- The same overall dimensions as the original
- A valid path from start (S) to goal (G)
- A different specific layout while maintaining the same general shape
- Proper encoding using the specified format

The path from start to goal is possible by moving down the right side of the "7" shape, just as in the original maze, but with some additional corridor variations to make it distinct from the original while maintaining the same basic "7" shape.
