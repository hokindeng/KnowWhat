# Maze Navigation Task

You are tasked with solving a maze provided to you as an image. You goal is to complete the maze, move-by-move, by finding a path from a start position to an end position. Below are detailed instructions for the task.

## Maze Representation

The attached image is a maze represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the maze has coordinates displayed as (row,column), with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The grid uses the following color coding:

* WHITE cells (walls): These are obstacles you CANNOT move through
* DARK GREY cells (paths): These are empty cells you CAN move through
* BLUE cell (player): Your current position in the maze
* RED cell (goal): Your destination that you need to reach

## Movement Rules

1. You can ONLY move to adjacent cells in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
2. Diagonal movement is NOT allowed
3. You can ONLY move through empty (DARK GREY) cells
4. You CANNOT move through walls (WHITE cells)
5. Each move must be to a directly adjacent cell (no skipping cells)

## Your Task

Navigate from your current position (BLUE cell) to the goal (RED cell) by providing a sequence of coordinates, one move at a time.

## How to Respond

1. Analyze the maze carefully 
2. Identify a valid path from your current position to the goal
3. Provide your next move as coordinates in the format (row,column)
4. After each of your moves, I will show you an updated maze with your new position
5. Continue providing one move at a time until you reach the goal

## Success Condition

The task is completed when you successfully reach the RED goal cell.

## Example Response

To move to the cell below your current position, you would respond with the coordinates of that cell, such as:

'Next move: (5,3)'

Here is the maze you need to solve:
Looking at the maze, I can see that I'm currently at the blue cell position (5,3) and need to reach the red goal cell at (1,3). I can move through the dark grey cells but not through the white walls.

From my current position, I can move either left to (5,2) or right to (5,4). Looking at the overall path to the goal, I should move left as this will allow me to eventually work my way up to the goal.

Next move: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (5,2), I can move either left to (5,1) or up to (4,2). Since I need to reach the goal at (1,3), I should move left to (5,1) which will allow me to start moving upward through the available path.

Next move: (5,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (5,1), I can now move up to (4,1), which will continue my path toward the goal at (1,3). This is the only valid move available since I'm blocked by walls on the left and bottom, and I've already come from the right.

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (4,1), I can continue moving up to (3,1), which maintains my progress toward the goal at (1,3). This is again the only valid move available as I'm blocked by walls on both sides and I've come from below.

Next move: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (3,1), I can continue moving up to (2,1), which will get me closer to the goal at (1,3). After that, I'll need to move right to reach the goal. This is still the only valid move available as I'm blocked by walls on both sides and I've come from below.

Next move: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (2,1), I can move up to (1,1), which will put me one step closer to the goal. After this move, I'll need to move right twice to reach the goal at (1,3). The path is becoming clear now.

Next move: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (1,1), I can move right to (1,2), which will put me one step away from the goal. This is the clear next step on the path to reach the goal at (1,3).

Next move: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (1,2), I can make the final move right to (1,3) to reach the goal. This will complete the maze!

Next move: (1,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

# Maze Shape Recognition and Generation Task

Now that you have solved the maze, you need to perform to additional tasks:

1. Recognize the shape of the maze you just solved
2. Generate a new maze with the same shape

Let me explain each of these additional tasks.

## Part 1: Shape Recognition

Examine the maze you just solved and identify the overall pattern or shape formed by the non-wall cells (corridors). Note that this should NOT be the shape of the path from start to finish, but rather the shape formed by ALL non-wall cells, including empty cells, start cell, and finish cell.

Provide the name of the shape you recognize. Be specific and explain your reasoning.

## Part 2: Maze Generation

Create a new maze with the following specifications:

### Requirements:

1. **Same dimensions**: Your new maze must have exactly the same height and width as the original maze
2. **Same shape pattern**: The corridors (non-wall cells) must form the same general shape you identified in Part 1
3. **Valid path**: There must be at least one valid path from start to goal positions
4. **Different layout**: While maintaining the same shape, your maze should NOT be an identical copy of the original
5. **Proper encoding**: Use the same encoding format as described below

### Encoding Format:

Encode your maze as a text matrix with the following symbols:
* '1' for walls (representing WHITE cells)
* '0' for empty corridors (representing DARK GREY cells)
* 'S' for the player starting position (representing the BLUE cell)
* 'G' for the goal position (representing the RED cell)

### Example Response:

If you identified the shape as a '{shape}', your response would be:

Part 1: The maze corridors form a {shape} shape. This is evident from {explanation}.

Part 2: Here is my new {shape}-shaped maze with the same dimensions (5x5):

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Please provide both Part 1 (recognition) and Part 2 (generation) in your response.
Part 1: The maze corridors form an "L" shape. This is evident from the continuous path of dark grey and colored cells that starts from the bottom, goes up vertically along the left side, and then turns right at the top to form a horizontal segment - creating a clear "L" pattern when viewing all accessible cells together.

Part 2: Here is my new L-shaped maze with the same dimensions (7x7):

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 S G 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- I maintained the L-shape pattern of accessible cells
- The start (S) and goal (G) positions are placed differently than the original
- There is a valid path between S and G
- The overall dimensions are the same (7x7)
- The L-shape is formed by the corridor running up the left side and across the top
- The maze is different from the original while maintaining the same basic shape pattern
